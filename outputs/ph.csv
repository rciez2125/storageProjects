The dam&#039;s power plant contains 2 x 211 MW pumped-storage generators than can generate power in the normal way by allowing water to flow through its turbines. However, during periods when the demand for electricity is low (such as evenings, weekends, or during seasonal fluctuations), the dam can use its excess power generating capacity to pump water back into the reservoir—enhancing reservoir capacity and storing water for periods when the demand for electricity is high. At the time it was constructed, the Aldeadávila Dam had the largest pumping station in Europe.   The Aldeadávila Dam has two diversion tunnels, each 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in length. Each tunnel has a 53-metre (174 ft) high surge tank. The dam also contains more than 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of tunnels which divert water to the electrical generation turbines. There are six penstock tunnels, each about 5 metres (16 ft) in diameter. The design of the penstocks and auxiliary spillways using these tunnels has proved to be an issue, however. Cavitation problems have damaged these tunnels in the past. Until the Alcantara Dam was built in 1969, the Aldeadávila Dam was the largest hydroelectric power plant in Europe. As of 2010, it remains the largest in Spain. The dam&#039;s hydroelectric power station originally housed six 170,000 horsepower (130,000 kW) Francis turbines which generated 718 MW, about half that of Hoover Dam.In 1987, the Aldeadávila II power station extension was completed, boosting generating capacity by 400 MW.  http://www.exergy.se/goran/hig/ses/06/hydro.pdf",1139000.0,,,,40.93702879999999,-5.67,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Duero,Salamanca,Spain,,01.01.1986,01.01.1956,,,,,,,Iberdrola,0.0,,60000000.0,0.0,,,DD.48.YYYY 03:48:40,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

276,Tanbara Pumped Hydro Power Station,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"Tamahara Dam (玉原ダム) is a rock-fill embankment dam on a Tone River tributary in Gunma Prefecture of Japan. It is located 14 km (9 mi) north of Numata. It creates the upper reservoir for the 1,200 MW Tamahara Pumped Storage Power Station (玉原発電所). Construction began in 1973 and the dam was complete in 1981 while the power station was commissioned in 1986. It is 116 m (381 ft) tall and withholds a reservoir with a storage capacity of 14,800,000 m3 (11,999 acre·ft). Of that capacity, 13,000,000 m3 (10,539 acre·ft) is active (or useful) for power generation. The lower reservoir for the pumped-storage power station is created by the Fujiwara Dam, located 4 km (2 mi) to the northwest on another Tone River tributary. Power is generated during periods of high energy demand and pumping occurs during times when energy demand is low such as at night. The power station contains four 300 MW reversible Francis turbine pump-generators which serve to both pump water and generate electricity. The upper Tamahara Reservoir is at an elevation of 1,177 m (3,862 ft) and the lower Fujiwara Reservoir is at 651 m (2,136 ft) which affords the power station an effective hydraulic head of 518 m (1,699 ft). When pumping, the pump-generators can move up to 210 m3/s (7,416 cu ft/s) of water and when generating, they discharge up to 276 m3/s (9,747 cu ft/s).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamahara_Dam  http://www.jepic.or.jp/en/data/EPIJJapanData.pdf  http://www.suiryoku.com/gallery/gunma/tanbara/tanbara.html",1200000.0,,,,36.786266499999996,139.16,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Tone-gun,Gunma Prefecture,Japan,,01.01.1982,,,,,Investor Owned,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The dam also has structural volume of 2,338,000 m3 (82,565,691 cu ft) and withholds a reservoir of 7,227,000 m3 (5,859 acre·ft) of which 5,408,000 m3 (4,384 acre·ft) is active storage. From the upper reservoir, water can be released back down to the power station 34°53′30″N 135°51′34″E where the two 233 MW reversible Francis turbine pump-generators use it for power production.  This process can be repeated and generation usually occurs during peak usage periods. The high water level at the upper reservoir is 296 m (971 ft) above sea level while it is 78.5 m (258 ft) ASL in the lower reservoir. This affords the power station an effective hydraulic head of 219.35 m (720 ft). Its discharge capacity is 248 m3/s (8,758 cu ft/s).

It draws its energy from the force of the tide by using a tidal barrage. Instead of damming water on one side like a conventional dam, a tidal barrage first allows water to flow into a bay or river during high tide, and releasing the water back during low tide. This is done by measuring the tidal flow and controlling the sluice gates at key times of the tidal cycle. Turbines are then placed at these sluices to capture the energy as the water flows in and out.  The station&#039;s 24 reversible bulb pump-turbines are used to pump water into the river basin at high tide (for ebb generation). This energy is more than returned during generation, because power output is strongly related to the head. If water is raised 2 ft (61 cm) by pumping on a high tide of 10 ft (3 m), this will have been raised by 12 ft (3.7 m) at low tide. The cost of a 2 ft rise is returned by the benefits of a 12 ft rise.

The scheme was redeveloped to focus on pumped-storage in 1969, having been purchased by the Hydro Board from the British Aluminium Company (BAC). The scheme was originally built by BAC in 1896 and was the first large-scale commercial hydro-electric scheme in the UK, used to power an aluminium smelter also located here until this closed in 1967. BAC created a reservoir by joining two small lochs to form Loch Mhor, which lies 179 m above Loch Ness and 2 miles away.  During the redevelopment, a 5 MW turbine was installed in the original power station building to replace the original plant and provide pure hydro-electric generation, while the tunnels and pipes which carried the water were reused. The River Fechlin was diverted into Loch Mhor to provide additional water and, to support the pumped-storage system, new tunnels and a further power station were built.  A new power station was built to house two 150 MW Francis generation-motor sets, each weighing 914 tonnes, with 5 m wide turbine blades. 100 cubic meters of water pass through each turbine and out into the loch every second during generation. The turbines can be brought from a standstill to full power output in less than two minutes, which makes the station extremely responsive to demand. The new scheme became fully operational in 1975.

Thus, it contains a total of 2 500 m3 water. The plant is covered by a 3-meter soil layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the chosen dimensions, the membrane can store 34 kWh. It may not sound like much, but if the energy membrane is scaled by a factor 10 in all three dimensions, the stored amount of energy will reach 200 MWh which equals 8 hours of energy consumption by 50 000 single-family houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the demonstration plant is to test the geotechnical conditions and to prepare a mathematical model for the pumped storage.

Opened by the Queen in October 1965, it is one of four pumped storage power schemes in the UK, and has the distinction of being the world&#039;s first high head reversible pumped-storage hydro scheme. The station has also been used as the setting for several films, including the James Bond film The World is not Enough.  Nicknamed The Hollow Mountain, Cruachan was constructed between 1959 and 1954 and is unique in that the station is concealed within the hollowed out rock of Ben Cruachan, 3,694 feet (1,126 m), which overlooks the visitor centre. It was conceived and designed by Sir Edward MacColl, a Scottish engineer and a pioneer of hydro electricity in Scotland, with numerous projects to his credit. The only visible features are the dam, which is 1,000 feet (316 m) wide and located 1,300 feet (390 m) up the mountain, and the station offices and visitor centre, which lie on the loch side below the dam, and next to the road.  Buried in the mountain and accessed by a tunnel 23 feet (7 m) wide and 13 feet (4 m) high, the main cavern houses four motor-generator sets capable of generating a total output of 440 MW. Construction of the main cavern, similar in size to a football pitch, required the excavation of 220,000 cubic metres of rock and soil.  The station can operate for 22 hours before the supply of water in the reservoir is exhausted, and is required to maintain a 12 hour emergency supply in reserve.

1031,Lewiston Pump-Generating Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Niagara project, located about 4 1/2 miles downstream from the Falls, consists of two main facilities: the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant, with 13 turbines, and the Lewiston Pump-Generating Plant, with 12 pump-turbines. In between the two plants is a forebay capable of holding about 740 million gallons of water; behind the Lewiston plant, a 1,900-acre, 22 billion gallon reservoir holds additional supplies of this liquid fuel.  Water is diverted from the Niagara River—up to 375,000 gallons a second—and conveyed through conduits under the City of Niagara Falls to Lewiston. From there, water flowing through the Robert Moses plant spins turbines that power generators, converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy.  At night, when electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units operate as pumps, transporting water from the forebay up to the plant&#039;s reservoir.  During the daytime, when electricity use peaks, the Lewiston pumps are reversed and become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant. In this way, the water can be used to produce electricity twice, increasing production and efficiency.  To balance the need for power with a desire to preserve the beauty of Niagara Falls, the United States and Canada signed a treaty in 1950 that regulates the amount of water diverted for hydroelectricity production. On average, more than 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), or 1.5 million gallons of water a second, flow from Lake Erie into the Niagara River. The 1950 pact requires that at least 100,000 cfs of water spill over the Falls during the daylight hours in the tourist season, April through October. This flow may be cut in half at night during this period and at all times the rest of the year.  *** Update on progress of facility upgrade:  https://www.nypa.gov/NYPAPressCenter/PressRelease/News/NYPA%20Completes%20Upgrade%20on%20First%20of%2012%20TurbineGenerator%20Units%20at%20Niagara%20Plant%E2%80%99s%20Lewiston%20PumpGenerating%20Facility.html",240000.0,,,,43.142984000000006,-79.02,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, ",Lewiston,New York,United States,,28.01.1961,18.03.1957,,NYISO,New York Power Authority (NYPA),Public Owned,Transmission,,,0.0,Performance metrics not available.,0.0,0.0,,,DD.25.YYYY 00:25:19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The power plant, rated at 435 MW, was built by the Pennsylvania Electric Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. It began commercial operation in 1970. Through business mergers and acquisitions, the plant is now owned by FirstEnergy, an operator of several base load (nuclear and coal-fired) power plants. Pumped storage plants function similarly to a storage battery; they absorb excess power generated by such plants in off-peak hours, such as nighttime, using it to pump water into a reservoir.

Russell Dam enables a unique capability within the Savannah River Basin as a provider of “pumpback” hydropower. Pumpback turbines are reversible, so they allow the system to re-use water stored in the reservoir system multiple times. This capability is especially helpful during hot, dry summers when the facility can provide more peak-demand electricity with the same amount of water again and again.  The pumpback units are typically operated seven days a week but only during the night. By pumping back at night-time, the system maximizes the benefit to taxpayers because night-time electricity costs about a third less than day-time electricity (due to decreased power demand).  Starting about one hour after sunset, the designated generators are switched into pumpback mode. Once they reverse direction, these units pull water from below the Russell Dam (in the upper portion of Thurmond Lake) and pump it back upstream into Russell Lake.

It is owned and operated by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA). Its construction was in response to growing power demands and a lack of dam sites on the Grand River. The first phase was completed in 1968 and the second in 1971. The upper reservoir for the power station is Lake W. R. Holway which was built on Saline Creek and the lower reservoir is Lake Hudson on the Grand River. During periods of lower power demand, water is pumped from Lake Hudson to Lake Holway and released back down through the pump-generators during periods of high energy demand.  The project was constructed in two stages:  Stage 1 consisted of building an earth and rock filled dam in Chimney Rock Hollow 185 feet (56 m) high, creating Chimney Rock Reservoir. A canal 1,850 feet (560 m) long led from the dam to a forebay structure that had openings for steel penstocks,each 14 feet (4.3 m) in diameter. Three penstocks led from the forebay to a powerhouse that housed three 64,000 horsepower pump-generators, with a total rated capacity of 130 megawatts. This stage was completed in 1968.  Stage 2 comprised building three more penstocks, extending the powerhouse and adding three more pump-generators, all identical to those installed in Stage 1. This doubled the facility&#039;s capacity to 260 mw. It was completed in 1971.  The SPSP is controlled remotely from the GRDA Energy Control Center at the Robert S.

Plans of the Österreichische Bundesbahnen followed after 1945. In 1952, Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG (ÖDK) carried out water and energy-related tests and created a plan for the utilisation of the Malta and Gößbäche with a three-stage power plant group. A dissertation written in 1956 at the technical university in Graz by Erich Magnet with the title &quot;Winter Storage Plant Inner Maltatal-Kolbnitz&quot; was used by Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG and proved to be very important for the development of the project.  The water rights negotiations for the Malta upper stage and Malta main stage power plants took place in 1964. The approval of the water authorities was granted in 1965. Heavy protests, especially from the Austrian Society for Nature Conservation, followed when the project area lost its nature conservation status. The conservationists called for the erection of nuclear power stations as an alternative to storage power plants. The detailed planning commenced in 1971 following the positive construction decision.  In addition to covering demand peaks, it was required that the power plant group Malta must, at all times, be in a position to provide reserve power for a failed nuclear power plant. The earlier-than-expected issuing of the building decision and the new requirements created major challenges for the planning and construction departments. In addition, the first machine unit for the main stage was to be commissioned two years earlier than expected on 1 December 1978. The planning was carried out, inter alia, by Construction Director Kurt Baustädter, Rudolf Mußnig, Kurt Landl, Heiner Ludescher and Georg Lichtenegger from Draukraftwerke AG. External planners, such as the civil technology company Ehß, were also engaged. The architectural work was carried out by Rudolf Nitsch from Klagenfurt.  After a series of geological tests, the final location for Rottau power plant was fixed in 1973. The excavation pit reached a depth of approximately 30 metres below the valley basin and 25 metres below the groundwater level. Extensive safety measures were necessary to prevent the penetration of groundwater. The first machine unit was commissioned in Rottau power plant in late autumn 1976. The storage pumps were commissioned in summer 1978.

The planned pooling of all the water from the Hohe Tauern into the Kaprun Valley was interrupted due to the outbreak of the global economic crisis at the beginning of the 1930&#039;s. With Austria&#039;s annexation to the German Reich in the spring of 1938, the project was once again made a high priority and re-designed under the head of the newly founded Alpen Elektrowerke AG (AEW [Alpine Power Company]), Hermann Grengg. The new plans contemplated a two stage pumped storage power plant with an upper storage reservoir on the Mooserboden and Wasserfallboden storage lakes above the Limberg Alp. The construction work began with the construction of new and expansion of existing access roads to the construction sites, in particular to the Kapruner Winkel [Kaprun Corner], the building site of the Hauptstufe [main stage] power house, and to the Limberg Alp. When the war ended, the Hauptstufe power house and a makeshift dam on the Wasserfallboden were ready for operation.  Construction of the Oberstufe [upper stage] power house could not begin, however until completion of the Limberg dam, which was to connect airside to the new structure. In the final phase of the work on the barrier, more and more attention was given to the archtectonic design of the Limberg power house. To this end, an invitation to tender was held to design of the crown of dam and powerhouse with architect Harald Bauer&#039;s design being selected. For the power house however, the third-placed architect Edith Lassmann&#039;s design was selected.  The contract was awarded at the beginning of 1951 and the excavation work for the power house to be attached to the nearly completed dam began immediately thereafter. Between May and August 1951 alone, around 10,000 m³ of rock was removed from the area of the foundations for the new power house. The construction materials were transported via a tow-railway from the Bruck/Fusch station to the Kapruner Winkel and from there taken to the Limberg site with a cement cable railway.  In 1953 the construction work on the main structure was completed. Construction on the stilling basin continued until June 1954 since the final form was not set until after extensive studies and model tests had been carried out by the planning department of Tauernkraftwerke AG.  The first machine set was commissioned on 14 November 1954, the second on1 December 1955. Both of the Möll connecting bridge pumps in the pump cave next to the Drossensperre retaining wall followed on 28 May 1956.

A total of ten deep borehole explosions had to be carried out in the excavation of the construction pit. The building is in paint-ready, in-situ concrete, supplemented by prefabricated concrete units, executed and divided into three blocks of roughly equal lengths by means of expansion joints. The roof over the machinery hall comprises prefabricated, reinforced concrete components. The uphill-facing distribution lines were embedded in a solid concrete block.  Strain was nevertheless caused by the encasing in concrete of the pumps and turbine coils, as well as the firm anchoring of the building with the rock. In the surface construction, pillars were covered with concrete at intervals of some 6 m and connected via two 8 or 15 m reinforced concrete girders that lay across the operating floor. The lower girder is connected to the rock by means of high tensile bars; the upper girder serves for slope stabilisation and simultaneously forms the uphill support for the roofing slab. The flat roofs are landscaped with vegetation. The concrete surfaces have a light-coloured interior coating; the floors of the machinery hall and the upper part of the walls are clad with red clinker slabs.

1423,Malta Upper Stage Pumped Storage Power Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"History of the Power Plant  The first plans for the energy-technical utilisation of the waters at the upper end of the Malta Valley, which is known for its extremely high precipitation levels, date back to the 1930s. The decision by Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG (ÖDK) to construct the three-stage Malta power plant, however, did not follow until 1957. The power plants comprise an upper stage with Kölnbrein reservoir and Galgenbichl power house, the main stage with Galgenbichl reservoir in the upper Malta valley between Gamskarnock and Lausnock, the main stage power house in Rottau near Kolbnitz in the Möll valley as well as the lower stage with a diversion channel in the Möll valley and Möllbrücke power house in the Drau valley.  Given that it had only been established for a short time, ÖDK did not, however, have the financial resources necessary to construct the Reißeck, Kreuzeck and Malta power plants at the same time. For this reason, detailed planning did not commence until 1961 following the completion of the Reißeck-Kreuzeck power plants. In 1965, the Malta-Upper Stage and Malta-Main Stage projects were approved by the water authorities.  The construction work for Galgenbichl power house followed after commencement of work on the Kölnbrein Dam and the Galgenbichl reservoir. The construction warehouse was extended in April 1974 and work on the development of the construction site commenced. Machinery and equipment from the neighbouring construction site at Galgenbichl Dam were used during the construction period.  The excavation work commenced in the east section of the power house, and due to the tight time schedule, continued through winter 1974/75. The work to stabilise the 40-metre cliff to the west of the power house to which parts of the building are attached proved to be a major challenge. An external firm was commissioned to supply and prepare 800 tons of twisted ribbed steel so as to save time by working parallel. In spite of weather-related delays, work on the assembly of the first machine commenced on 1 September 1975 and the assembly of the second machine followed in 1976.  The power house was handed over to ÖDK on 1 September 1976.

The high Alpine project area for the pumped storage power plant Reisseck II is located in Mühldorfer Graben at a height of up to 2,300 metres (m) where the Great Mühldorfer Lake will later function as an upper basin. The cavern power plant Reisseck II will be erected 1,585 m above sea level in the mountain and equipped with two powerful pump turbines.  Similar to a normal storage power plant, Reisseck II will produce peak electricity in high demand periods, whereby water will be transported via a works water channel from Great Mühldorfer Lake to the two turbines that drive the generators. The processed water will run into a lower basin.  Both of the machines units in the mountain can be switched to pump operation, whereby the generators will then function as motors and the turbines will pump the water from the lower basin back up to the upper basin. Pump operation will take place during the day when the European grid is carrying more electricity than is required by the consumers. Energy which, for example, comes from the large wind farms or the Danube power plants can be saved in the form of pumped-up water. The pumped storage power plant Reisseck II will therefore function as a &quot;green battery&quot; in the Alps. The power plant will have a capacity of 430 megawatt (MW), both in turbine and pump operation. This corresponds to the electricity generating capacity of approximately 200 wind turbines.  On completion of the rock cavern for the power plant in 2011, the boring of the works water channel to Great Mühldorfer Lake commenced in the first half of 2012 with an 880-ton (t) and 220 m tunnel boring machine.

1515,Ludington Pumped Storage,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Ludington Pumped Storage Plant sits on a 1,000-acre site along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The plant was built between 1969-73 and is jointly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison, and operated by Consumers Energy. The plant contributes directly to local governments about $11 million in annual property taxes.  Revenue from plant operations, maintenance and overhauls also contribute significant sums to the local economy.  Local residents still refer to the plant as “The Project”.  One of the world’s biggest electric “batteries”, Ludington can provide energy at a moment’s notice. Its ability lies in its 27-billion gallon reservoir and a set of six turbines that drive electric generators.  Those same turbines double as giant water pumps to fill the reservoir with water from Lake Michigan. At night, when electric demand is low, Ludington’s reversible turbines pump water 363 feet uphill from Lake Michigan. The water is pumped through six large pipes, or “penstocks”, to the 842-acre reservoir. During the day, when electric demand is high, the reservoir releases water to flow downhill through the penstocks. The flowing water turns turbines and generators in the powerhouse to make electricity. The plant can generate up to 1,872 megawatts — enough electricity to serve a community of 1.4 million residential customers. The output is more than double the capacity of any single unit on Consumers Energy’s system. Ludington’s relatively simple technology enables the plant to respond quickly to the daily, weekly and seasonal highs and lows of Michigan’s energy demand. The plant also saves customers money by enabling Consumers Energy to avoid the expensive spot market when customer demand exceeds the capacity of the company’s baseload plants.  The immense size of Ludington and its six-unit design offers flexibility in balancing customer demand with electric output on a moment’s notice.   Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison announced an $800 million upgrade on February 7 2011.

The four-unit station began generating electricity in 1991, and is the largest hydroelectric station on the Duke Energy system. It is named for the two streams, Bad Creek and West Bad Creek, which were dammed to create the Bad Creek reservoir.  The Bad Creek facility utilizes two reservoirs (or lakes) to generate electricity: an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir. Water stored in an upper lake is released into underground power tunnels. The water rushes down the tunnels, driving huge turbines, which are underground at the base of a dam. The spinning turbines are connected to large generators, which produce the electricity. The water then flows through draft tubes into a lower lake.  A pumped-storage hydroelectric station uses the same water over and over again, making more efficient use of water resources. When demand for electricity is low, operators can refill the lake, as if they were “recharging” a battery. Using power from other generating stations, the generators act as electric motors spinning the huge turbines backward. This pumps water back up the power tunnels into the upper lake. Water is generally pumped back to the upper reservoir at night and on weekends.  With the reservoir at full-pond elevation and generating with all four units, Bad Creek can generate for 24 hours within its maximum 160’ drawdown.

New Waddell Dam&#039;s primary purpose is to store Colorado River water for CAP use. The dam also stores Agua Fria River runoff and provides flood protection by controlling river flows. The dam is located one-half mile downstream of historic Waddell Dam, which was built by the Maricopa Water District (MWD). The dam&#039;s reservoir, Lake Pleasant, also stores water for MWD irrigation.  In the winter, Colorado River water is pumped uphill from the CAP aqueduct into Lake Pleasant when power rates are low. In the summer, when demand for water and electricity increases, water is released through the Pump-Generating plant, producing hydroelectric power that is sold to help repay the CAP&#039;s construction costs. In addition, New Waddell Dam adds 7,000 surface acres to the lake, greatly increasing the recreational value of Lake Pleasant Regional Park.  Handicapped-accessible recreational facilities include 3 multiple-lane boat ramps, 450 picnic sites, 225 campsites, 14 group use areas, 4 overlooks, a full-service marina equipped to handle 1000 boats, and 7 miles of trail. Because the reservoir water level may fluctuate up to 125 feet during a typical year&#039;s operation, the facilities will be located to be accessible during both high and low water periods.  If necessary, floodwaters can be released from the dam through the river outlet works tunnel into the Agua Fria River immediately below the dam. If the reservoir&#039;s flood storage capacity is ever exceeded, water can also be released over spillways located west of the dam. This water would flow down Morgan City Wash and back to the Agua Fria River about one mile below the dam.  The cost of constructing New Waddell Dam was more than $625 million.

1534,Helms Pumped Hydro Storage Project,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The power plant operates by moving water between two reservoirs, an upper and a lower. When energy demand is high, water is released from the upper reservoir to the plant where electricity is generated before the water is discharged into the lower reservoir. When demand is low at times such as night, water is then pumped back up to the upper reservoir to be used as stored energy for a later time. This is accomplished by pump-generators which serve a dual role as both pumps which can reverse into generators. The plant can go from a stand still to operational in eight minutes which allows it to meet peak energy demand. It consumes more electricity pumping versus generating electricity but pumping occurs during periods of low demand, making the plant economical.

This water is used to irrigate approximately 670,000 acres of farmland in the Columbia Basin Project. More than 60 crops are grown in the basin and distributed across the nation  Construction of the irrigation facilities began in 1948. Components of the project include the pump-generating plant, feeder canal, and equalizing reservoir, which was later named Banks Lake. Banks Lake was formed by damming the northern 27 miles of the Grand Coulee, and has an active storage capacity of 715,000 acre-feet. The lake stores water for irrigation and also provides important recreational benefits to the region. The pump-generating plant began operation in 1951. From 1951 to 1953, six pumping units, each rated at 65,000 horsepower and with a capacity to pump 1,600 cubic feet per second, were installed in the plant.   In the early 1960s, investigations revealed the potential for power generation. Reversible pumps were installed to allow water from Banks Lake to flow back through the units to generate power during periods of peak demand. The first three generating pumps came online in 1973. Two more generating pumps were installed in 1983; the final generating pump was installed in January 1984. The total generating capacity of the plant is now 314,000 kilowatts.
