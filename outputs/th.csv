43,Dulles TES Tank for Internet Service Provider,Thermal Storage,Chilled Water Thermal Storage,Chilled Water Thermal Storage,Operational,"In 2006, a large Internet Service Provider (ISP) located in Dulles, VA selected DN Tanks to build a mission critical Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tank to service their data center. The data center which operates 24 hours each day could not afford the consequences that would result if their chilled water cooling system were to experience downtime. This TES tank, now our third built TES tank for this same ISP, was designed to provide back-up cooling for the central plant in the event that the chillers experience unexpected downtime.  The engineer for the project, Dunlap &amp;amp; Partners, designed the revisions to the chilled water system which included the addition of a new TES tank. The tank was specified to be capable of storing enough chilled water equal to the peak cooling load for the facility for a period of two hours. In addition, the chilled water pressure drop through the tank was specified to stay below 3 psi even in the event that the pumps were to require a delivery flow rater of 5,184 gpm which is the maximum flow rate to the building.  Poole &amp;amp; Kent, the mechanical contractor, provided the new chilled water piping, pumps, and valves in addition to overseeing the installation of this TES tank. DN Tanks together with Poole &amp;amp; Kent worked closely with the owner and engineers in ensuring that the TES system was constructed within the agreed upon schedule, and commissioned expeditiously so that the data center would be protected with this reservoir of chilled water.  In August of 2007, representatives of the owner, the mechanical contractor, the engineer, and DN Tanks commissioned the TES system. The commissioning process included shutting down all chillers during the middle of a weekday of the data center operation. Immediately upon shutting down the chillers, the new TES system was energized and chilled water from the TES tank became the sole source of cooling for the facility. The system remained in this mode for 1 hour and 40 minutes, while the TES tank operated flawlessly.",0.0,,,,38.962489899999994,-77.44,,"Resiliency, ",Dulles,Virginia,United States,,01.08.2007,,,PJM,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

As a part of the expansion of the central plant, a 2.0 million gallon chilled water Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tank was designed into the district cooling system by P2S Engineering, Inc.  The tank was designed and built for a useable TES capacity of 20,000 ton-hours and a maximum chilled water flow rate of 5,000 gallons per minute. The tank was designed to provide cooling for the campus during the peak electric period of time during the afternoon, allowing the chiller equipment to de-energize during this time, and permanently reduce the electric demand.

Studios #1 - Ice Energy,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energy’s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how – and more importantly when – energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites. When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.",8.0,,,,34.149829600000004,-118.34,,"Electric Bill Management, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Burbank,California,United States,02.03.2015,,,,,Burbank Water &amp;amp; Power,Public Owned,,,Ice Energy,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,DD.10.YYYY 23:10:18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The innovation started in the tidy development of Stones Throw in East Stroudsburg, where developers had installed identical ETS units in the 1980′s and ’90s, making it a perfect place to pilot VCharge’s technology. Now, over 40 Stones Throw homeowners, and nearly another 100 in the surrounding area, have installed free controls on their ETS heaters to participate in this radical experiment in grid storage and energy management–and to get a 25% discount on their home heating bills.  By itself, any individual heating system is relatively unremarkable. But together, the 134 homes in VCharge’s Aggregated Transactive Load Asset (ATLAS) create a huge resource for grid balancing–specifically providing ancillary services like fast frequency response through the markets run by PJM.

JCPenney is currently faced with a ratcheted demand charge from its utility as well as coincident peak charge, which make up a large portion of the company’s monthly utility bill.  With the ratcheted demand pricing, the month with the highest energy usage sets the annual peak demand charge. In 2013, the annual peak demand charge was set in August at $37,479. The charge is ratcheted at 80 percent, which means that for the 11 months following August, JCPenney pays a demand charge of $29,983 (80 percent of $37,479). This applies unless a new peak demand is set, in which case the process starts over.   The other significant demand charge that JCPenney’s Headquarters incurs is called a Transmission Cost Recovery Factor, also known as a 4CP or coincident peak demand charge.

These two feeders serve the planned FortZED Jump Start Zone (Ft. Collins Zero Energy District, in which the district creates as much thermal and electrical energy locally as it uses). This project will modernize and transform the electrical distribution system of the City of Fort Collins by reducing distribution feeder peak loads, increasing the penetration of renewables, and delivering improved efficiency and reliability to the grid and resource asset owners. Fort Collins is well positioned to successfully complete this project due to 1) the unique combination of world-class research facilities at Colorado State University, 2) participation of global industry leaders and local entrepreneurs able to commercialize the technology, 3) the City of Fort Collins’ focus on and investments in clean energy as a key pillar of future growth, and 4) the presence of a city-owned utility and extensive community support.    As a small portion of this project, thermal storage will be installed at the following sites:    Site 1: New Belgium Brewing -- deploys new 200-kW PV arrays with AE inverters; a 292-kW methane-based Gauscor CHP; a 650-kW CAT 3508C methane-based CHP; a 135-kW new thermal storage; and a 160-kW load shedding potentials.

Heat storage materials are critical to the energy storage process. In solar thermal storage systems, heat can be stored in these materials during the day and released at night--when the sun is not out--to drive a turbine and produce electricity. In nuclear storage systems, heat can be stored in these materials at night and released to produce electricity during daytime peak-demand hours.   Halotechnics new thermal storage material targets a price that is potentially cheaper than the molten salt used in most commercial solar thermal storage systems today. It is also extremely stable at temperatures up to 1200°C--hundreds of degrees hotter than the highest temperature molten salt can handle. Being able to function at high temperatures will significantly increase the efficiency of turning heat into electricity.

1344,Ice Energy project at 1228 West Ave I,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energy’s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how – and more importantly when – energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites.
