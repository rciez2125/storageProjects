20,Angas A-CAES (Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage) Project – Hydrostor,Compressed Air Energy Storage,Compressed Air Energy Storage,Compressed Air Energy Storage,Under Construction,"&lt;p&gt;The Angas A-CAES Project, located near Strathalbyn, South Australia, is Australia’s first Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) Facility. The project utilizes Hydrostor’s emissions-free, long duration energy storage technology, and is sited at a mine 50 km southeast of Adelaide—the Angas Zinc Mine, currently in care and maintenance. By selecting this site, the project will repurpose existing underground mining infrastructure as the A-CAES system’s sub-surface air storage cavern, benefiting both the electricity grid in South Australia and the local community by converting an unused brownfield site into a clean energy project that drives economic development. The 5 MW/10 MWh facility will be dispatched into Australia’s National Electricity Market (“NEM”) to provide synchronous inertia, load shifting, frequency regulation, and support grid services and reliability. It will also enable the integration of variable renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind. The project has been awarded a combined total of $9 million of grant funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Government of South Australia Renewable Technology Fund and is expected to be in service in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;",5000.0,,,,-35.251,138.916,,"Demand Response, Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, Renewables Capacity Firming, Renewables Energy Time Shift, Resiliency, Voltage Support, ",Strathalbyn,South Australia,Australia,,,,,AEMO,,Investor Owned,Transmission,,Hydrostor,30.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
21,Goderich A-CAES (Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage) Commercial Demonstration Facility – Hydrostor,Compressed Air Energy Storage,Compressed Air Energy Storage,Compressed Air Energy Storage,Contracted,"&lt;p&gt;The Goderich A-CAES Facility is a commercial energy storage plant, located in Goderich, Ontario, Canada which utilizes Hydrostor’s proprietary Advanced Compressed Air Energy Storage (A-CAES) technology, a long-duration, emissions-free energy storage solution. The facility is contracted by Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) for peaking capacity, ancillary services, and full participation in the merchant energy market. The 1.75 MW peak output, 2.20 MW charge rating, and up to 15 MWh storage capacity plant (contracted to 7 MWh) is a utility-scale commercial application of the technology and the largest fuel-free (adiabatic) CAES system in the world, conforming to all interconnection, uptime, performance and dispatch requirements / standards as set out by the IESO. The project proves the ability of Hydrostor’s A-CAES technology to participate in an advanced electricity market and to provide a range of grid services. With it Hydrostor operates the world’s first two fuel-free (adiabatic) A-CAES systems.&lt;/p&gt;",1750.0,,,,43.732,-81.6905,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, Renewables Capacity Firming, Renewables Energy Time Shift, ",Goderich,Ontario,Canada,,,,,IESO,,Investor Owned,Transmission,,Hydrostor,30.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

With the completion of the Toronto A-CAES Facility in 2015, Hydrostor developed the world’s first, grid connected adiabatic-CAES facility. The project has been in service and operational since November 2015, with an installed capacity of 660 kW, 1 MWh. The project successfully demonstrated A-CAES performance in a grid-connected environment and provides an ongoing testbed, with a potential long-term role as reserve power for Toronto Island. The project was supported by the Government of Canada’s Sustainable Development Technology Canada Fund and connected to the grid by Toronto Hydro. The facility demonstrated A-CAES’ ability to play a significant role in the long-duration energy storage market globally.&lt;/p&gt;",660.0,,,,43.613,-79.381,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, ",Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,IESO,,Investor Owned,Transmission,,Hydrostor,30.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
499,Pre-Commercial Liquid Air Energy Storage Technology Demonstrator - Highview Power Storage,Liquid Air Energy Storage,Liquid Air Energy Storage,Liquid Air Energy Storage,Under Construction,"Highview and project partners, recycling and renewable energy company, Viridor, were awarded more than £8 million of funding in 2014 from the UK Government Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), to build a 5MW Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES) technology system. The funding is supporting the design, build and testing of a pre-commercial LAES technology demonstrator alongside Viridor’s landfill gas generation plant at Pilsworth Landfill facility in Bury, Greater Manchester. In addition to providing energy storage, the LAES plant will convert low-grade waste heat, from the GE Jenbacher landfill gas engines, to power.  The project will operate for at least 1 year and will demonstrate LAES providing a number of balancing services, including Short Term Operating Reserve (STOR), Triad avoidance (supporting the grid during the winter peaks) and testing for the US regulation market. Construction on the project began in February 2015, it is currently in commissioning and is expected to be operational in early 2018.  In August 2017, Highview was awarded £1.5 million of funding by Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation agency for a new hybrid configuration of the existing 5MW liquid air energy storage (LAES) Pre-Commercial Demonstrator. The funding will enable Highview to use supercapacitors and flywheel technology to create the hybrid LAES system. It will demonstrate LAES’s ability to respond to grid frequency events within one second, meeting the requirements of National Grid’s new enhanced frequency response (EFR) service and firm frequency response (FFR) timescales to help keep the UK grid balanced. The aim of the project is to test performance and economics and it will be operational by Summer 2018.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3eOSApOA88  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88CzngeVpDo",5000.0,,,,53.5843377,-2.26,,"Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Non-Spinning, Frequency Regulation, Transmission Congestion Relief, Transmission Support, Voltage Support, ",Bury,Lancashire,United Kingdom,13.02.2014,,26.02.2015,,,Electricity North West,Investor Owned,Primary Distribution,,Highview Power Storage,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,DD.05.YYYY 00:05:18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
1552,Highview Pilot Plant - Relocated to University of Birmingham,Liquid Air Energy Storage,Compressed Air Storage,Liquid Air Energy Storage,De-Commissioned,"*** Relocated to the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Cryogenic Energy Storage. The pilot project was operated for four years before being donated to the University and Re-Commissioned at its new location on December 11, 2015.  Highview‘s technology uses off-peak or ‘wrong-time’ power to liquefy air (710 litres of air becomes one litre of liquid air), which is then held in a tank until electricity is required.  The liquid air is then returned to gaseous form, expanding 710 times, to drive a turbine.   Extreme cold is recovered and stored to assist with subsequent liquefaction, thus greatly improving the overall efficiency of the system.  If waste heat is available (e.g. from a neighbouring power plant or industrial process) then this can be introduced at the expansion phase, enhancing system efficiency.  http://www.energymatters.com.au/renewable-news/cryogenic-energy-storage-em5250/",350.0,,,,52.460800899999995,-1.91,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, ",Slough,Berkshire,United Kingdom,01.03.2010,11.12.2015,01.02.2011,,,SSE (Scottish and Southern Energy),,,,Highview Power Storage,0.0,,0.0,0.0,University of Birmingham Centre for Cryogenic Energy Storage (BCCES); University of Leeds + Queen Mary University of London,"Working with University of Leeds since 2004, we have completed the design, analysis, simulation and lab-testing of the key sub-systems.
