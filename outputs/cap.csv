In order to do this, a new generation of railway smart nodes has been developed to enable interoperability between urban/interurban transportation systems, users and the railway infrastructure. Win Inertia, as a technological solutions provider, uses the same environmental technological concept developed in the Ferrolinera project to create smart nodes over the railway infrastructure.  The Recuperation node, which incorporates Win Inertia’s hybrid energy storage system, allows recovery of the energy generated by the braking action of a train, storing it in Maxwell ultracapacitors according to an energy management algorithms’ assessment of the needs of the system at any given point in time.   The Recuperation node can be converted into an Interoperability node by adding Win Inertia’s EV charging point, which draws its supply from the same recovered energy from the braking process.",50.0,,,,36.708613299999996,-4.44,,"Microgrid Capability, On-Site Power, Onsite Renewable Generation Shifting, Renewables Capacity Firming, Transportation Services, Voltage Support, Microgrid Capability, ",Málaga,Málaga,Spain,01.02.2012,01.06.2015,14.01.2015,,,Administrator of Railway Infrastructures (Adif),Federally Owned,Secondary Distribution,,Win Inertia,25.0,,729064.0,12.0,Universidad de Jaen; Universidad de Sevilla - Electronic Technology Group; Universidad de Málaga - Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería Industrial,Jaen - PV installations of the Regulation node; Sevilla - Collaborated on the central management system for the nodes; Málaga - Defined energy potential for regenerative braking energy generation,DD.57.YYYY 01:57:08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Win Inertia designed and installed the system under a contract with the Spanish government&#039;s Administrator of Railway Infrastructures (ADIF). In this installation, the system also enables ADIF to store excess energy in a battery bank that supplies an electric vehicle (EV) charging station located at the rail station. The facility also seamlessly integrated a photovoltaic (PV) generator to supply additional energy if required.  The recuperation system employs Win Inertia&#039;s SHAD® hybrid control technology (international patent pending) to integrate batteries and Maxwell ultracapacitors to increase energy recovery efficiency and reduce stress on the batteries, thereby extending battery life. Ultracapacitors&#039; rapid charge/discharge characteristics uniquely enable them to capture and store more energy during each braking event than battery-based systems, which have limited ability to absorb energy in the few seconds required to stop a vehicle. Win Inertia&#039;s high-efficiency hybrid energy storage and power delivery system furthers ADIF&#039;s return on investment as it enables dual use of the recuperated energy for rail vehicle propulsion and EV charging. By converting kinetic energy into stored electric energy through regenerative braking, the system recovers 8 to 10 percent of the total energy used by the railway system, which is then used to power the EV charging station.",300.0,,,,40.37563,-3.68,,"On-Site Power, Onsite Renewable Generation Shifting, Renewables Capacity Firming, Transportable Transmission/Distribution Upgrade Deferral, Transportation Services, ",Madrid,Madrid,Spain,,15.01.2014,15.09.2013,,,Cerro Negro Energy Laboratory (ADIF),Cooperative (Customer Owned),Secondary Distribution,"PV, EV Charger",Win Inertia,12.0,,790962.0,12.0,University of Seville (Spain),Electronic Technology Group,DD.33.YYYY 00:33:44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
