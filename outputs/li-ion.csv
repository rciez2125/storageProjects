151,"Yokohama Smart City Project, SCADA Virtual Battery",Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"The Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) is an effort to develop a model for smart cities by means of cooperation between citizens, private companies, and the municipality, and to export the successful model to Japan and the rest of the world. Large-scale operational experiments are being held with Yokohama. The hierarchical bundling of energy management systems (EMS) enables energy management at the level of individual EMS and demand-side management at the level of the overall system.  One of the most unique undertakings of the Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) is the storage battery SCADA. SCADA stands for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition and is a device monitoring and control system. The storage battery SCADA uses multiple storage batteries as one massive virtual battery to control battery charging and discharging. This type of system is nearly unprecedented anywhere in the world, and creating the system has made it possible to achieve moderated demand response (DR).  Participating in the project are Toshiba Corporation, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Incorporated, Hitachi, Ltd., Meidensha Corporation, NEC Corporation, Sharp Corporation, and Sony Energy Devices Corporation.                              Two types of batteries are controlled by the storage battery SCADA: large batteries used to adjust electric power supply and demand; and stationary batteries used in homes, commercial buildings, and so on. The batteries used for supply and demand adjustments are lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Toshiba (300 kW), Hitachi (100 kW), and NEC and Meidensha Corporation through joint development (200 kW), providing total output of 600 kW. Batteries designed for users were installed in homes and commercial buildings by Sony Energy Devices, and batteries for office buildings in Yokohama were installed by Sharp. The storage battery SCADA performs three types of functions to control these batteries: daily operation, short-cycle supply and demand adjustment, and reserve power operation. The moderated DR mentioned above is achieved by daily operation. Specifically, the storage battery SCADA sends inquiries to home and commercial building users about their spare battery capacity on the following day. The responses received indicate how much spare capacity is available and when, as well as indicating that operations of a certain type are planned for a specific time, and therefore the remaining capacity may be used freely. Based on these responses, the storage battery SCADA borrows the spare capacity of user batteries and charges the batteries from the power grid at times when power demand is relatively low. The power company estimates the shortfall in electric power compared to the amount of power needed at peak times based on daily demand forecasts and supply plans. The storage battery SCADA receives requests from the power company, gathers spare battery capacity equal to the amount of the shortfall, and stores power. In addition, when sending inquiries about spare capacity to users, the system also asks how much the users want to be paid per kilowatt hour as an incentive (payment is made for capacity actually used in 30-minute increments). The storage battery SCADA selects batteries in homes and commercial buildings up to the required storage capacity starting with the lowest incentives. In this way, the electric power company can provide the necessary power by discharging batteries when electricity supply and demand is tight. The second function, short-cycle supply and demand adjustment, is a method of using supply and demand adjustment batteries to make up for the shortfall in short-cycle adjustment capacity provided by thermal electricity generation and hydroelectric power resulting from the introduction of renewable energy, which is subject to output fluctuations. Load frequency control is performed. The third function, reserve power operation, discharges supply and demand adjustment batteries during emergencies such as when an accident occurs to the power grid in order to minimize the effects of the accident.",600.0,,,,35.0,140.0,,"Electric Bill Management, Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, ",Yokohama,Kanagawa,Japan,27.03.2014,,,,,Tokyo Electric Power Corporation,,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,DD.16.YYYY 21:16:10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

315,Web2Energy Smart Grid Project ,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"Project objectives Three pillars of Smart Grids in distribution systems The project Web2Energy is directed to implement and approve all three pillars of &quot;Smart Distribution&quot;.  1. Smart Metering – the consumer participates in the energy market A few hundred electricity consumers in the supply area of HSE AG will be obtained with smart meters. These advanced meters provide many innovative functions:  Remote reading of metered values in short term intervals, Reception and visualization of price signals (variable rates) Disturbance signals and management of failures Estimation of manipulations and stolen energy Permanent meter data storage and monitoring of load profiles Supervision and control of distributed power producer, storage and controllable loads Furthermore, they provide gateways to monitor the current demand with the related costs and to further functions of building automation and in-house energy management (smart home). Variable (up to hourly) rates are offered to the clients. Current rates, the rate forecasts and the current demand are monitored. The consumer gets the opportunity to control his demand regarding non time critical loads in accordance with the offered rates. The project Web2Energy is able to achieve experiences with such a practice. The advanced meter technology comes from Landis + Gyr Austria.  2. Smart  Energy Management – Clustering of small power producers  A large number of small independent power producers are supervised and coordinated in such a way that at each moment a scheduled power feeds into the distribution network in accordance with the current demand or the request from the market. Consequently, the deviation of fluctuating wind or solar power from the predictions can be compensated in real-time through the aggregation with controllable generators, loads and storage in the framework of a virtual power plant (VPP). Inside the supply area of the HSE AG this coordination will be applied with benefits. Parallel with a number of volatile of wind power and photovoltaic plants a large number controllable hydro and thermo power plants with cogeneration of heat and power (CHP), storage and controllable industrial loads are in operation. They are able to contribute to the generation and load management. The central operated VPP participates on the markets for energy and control power and optimizes the operations and the overall power in-feed. In this way all participants can achieve higher efficiency and higher compensation of their expenses in comparison with the single market access. To support the VPP operations advanced storage technologies will be established. The EUS GmbH Dortmund implements the VPP procedures. The Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) contributes its experience of market access.  3. Smart Distribution Automation – higher reliability of supply Today supply interruptions happen very rarely. When they do occur, they are caused by 96% in the medium (MV)-/low (LV) voltage distribution networks. In the case of a disturbance an inspection team has to drive along the MV/LV-terminals for disturbance allocation and supply recovery by switching operations. These procedures take on average 1 hour or more. The Web2Energy project implements an automated sequence to execute the former manual processes in a selected area of the HSE AG. This approach cuts the supply interruption down to minutes. Consequently, the very high reliability of supply in Germany will be significantly improved. The necessary control technology comes from iPLS (PL).  Linking the users: All three pillars of smart distribution require the information exchange between the users of the network like consumers, producers, terminals, control centre of the network operator, traders and VPP.  Communication channels have to cover also the last meters to these participants.",5.0,,,,49.8776483,8.65,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, ",Darmstadt,Hesse,Germany,10.09.2013,,,,,HSE AG,,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,DD.44.YYYY 17:44:30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

434,Caterva SWARM,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"For the first time: Frequency Containment Reserve by privately used swarm of Energy Storage Systems  -	Successful pre-qualification as part of the SWARM pilot project  -	A contribution to the stabilization of the European power transmission grid system    On 20 July 2015, pre-qualification was for the first time obtained for a network of privately used solar Energy Storage Systems (ESS) for supply of Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) in Germany. As a result, 65 ESS in the SWARM pilot project were allowed to immediately contribute to stabilization of the power grid. The joint project by the technology and system supplier, Caterva GmbH, and by the Nuremberg community utility N-ERGIE Aktiengesellschaft, is supported by a grant of the State of Bavaria. Siemens AG is a technology partner.  The special feature of the large-scale virtual storage system is the networking of the storage units of household size. The ESS feature lithium-ion storage batteries. Siemens delivers the power electronics system.  Each ESS is provided with its own control unit, so that it can react on a stand-alone basis to grid frequency. The ESS, installed in private households, are connected via the UMTS network, with the control center at Caterva, which coordinates the households as a swarm. The control center acquires the latest individual data on storage-charging levels of the ESS and regulates the swarm such that the FCR, also known as frequency regulation or balancing power, on offer is actually available. At the TenneT control station, the data are forwarded online. The N-ERGIE power plant control station is responsible 24 by 7 for operator control and supervision of the large-scale virtual storage system, as it is for its own power generating facilities.   Double benefits for households  The beneficiaries of the ESS developed by Caterva – each with a total output rating of 20 kW and a capacity of 21 kWh – are the operators of private roof-top PV installations. Thanks to the storage systems, these users can cover 60 to 80 % of their power requirements from their own solar systems – and can at the same time contribute to German energy transition (Energiewende) by providing balancing power.  As a result of the considerably larger storage-battery capacity of the ESS in comparison to conventional PV buffer-storage, participation in the FCR market means no restriction to users in the consumption of the energy that they themselves have generated.   The first 65 ESS installations are distributed throughout the entire distribution system area of N-ERGIE, which is over 8,000 km² in size.   Contribution to grid stability  With provision of positive and negative FCR, the swarm enhances grid stability. Power balancing is necessary to compensate for the imbalance in power generation and consumption in such a way that grid frequency remains constant at 50 hertz. Balancing power is provided by transmission system operators in three specifications: FCR, Frequency Restoration Reserve, and Replacement Reserve (minute balancing power).  Demands placed on FCR are the strictest, since it must be provided within 30 seconds. Before Restoration and Replacement Reserve power, FCR is supplied directly proportionally to the deviation of grid frequency by each ESS.   Swarm Energy Storage Systems satisfy strictest requirements  The ESS swarm system has impressively fulfilled all requirements. The lithium-ion storage batteries installed in the ESS units enable a reaction period of just a few seconds. The large-scale virtual power storage system therefore balances fluctuation in the power grid within seconds and provides a key contribution to system stability.",1300.0,,,,49.45203,11.08,,"Frequency Regulation, On-Site Power, Renewables Energy Time Shift, ",Nuremberg,Bavaria,Germany,01.04.2014,15.07.2015,,,TenneT,N-ERGIE AG,,,,"Caterva, N-ERGIE",20.0,"More than one year successfull commercial delivery of balacing power, on average 2.700 kWh of additional self-consumption per home and year",0.0,0.0,,,DD.11.YYYY 17:11:31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

484,Shedd Aquarium-1MW lithium-ion battery,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"The aquarium installed a one-megawatt lithium battery weighing 30 tons on May 26. It’s the largest lithium-ion battery installed in any aquarium or zoo in the U.S. The goal is to cut the aquarium’s energy use in half by 2020. It&#039;s part of Shedd&#039;s Master Energy Roadmap plan, a green initiative started in 2012. In addition to the installation of the giant battery, the plan calls for replacing 75 percent of the aquarium’s lights with high efficiency LED lights and implementing enhanced automation systems that can adjust electricity use based on real-time shifts in electricity pricing. The $2 million battery will generate revenue for the Shedd by maintaining the area&#039;s electrical grid at a frequency of 60 hertz for the regional transmission organization PJM, which manages the grid. For example, if it&#039;s a cloudy day and the city&#039;s solar panels aren&#039;t generating enough electricity, the battery will distribute extra power. It will also serve as emergency back-up power for the Shedd.  The massive battery is visible to visitors from the loading dock outside or through the south Abbott Oceanarium window inside. The battery, along with an adjoining transformer and inverter skid, were funded in part by a $500,000 grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (IDCEO) and installed by Schneider Electric.

The new technology allows to maintain momentary power balance more efficiently.  KPX said the new technology will provide benefits of improving operation of electric power systems and creating new businesses as it allows thermal power plants to reduce cost factors in regulating frequency.  And, it will enable power generation companies to minimize high-cost LNG-fired power generation by increasing use of low-cost power generation, while avoiding construction of additional power plants needed for securing power reserves. It will also reduce emission of pollutant (yellow plume) and allow companies to reduce consumption of high-priced batteries thanks to ESS-based short cycle service.

No matter how many wind turbines or photovoltaic power plants are added to the grid, the lion’s share of the electricity supply has to be produced by diesel generators.  To break this dependence on diesel fuel, intelligent power controls and a purpose-built Energy Management System make the current grid independent of conventional generators, whose rotating mass now sets the pace. The new system combines software with a 6 MW / 3.2 MWh battery storage system, a 4.5 megawatt wind park and a 1 megawatt photovoltaic power plant.  The new, hybrid power system on Graciosa can immediately use up to 100 percent sun and wind power. The diesel generators will only be needed for back-up in weeks with very poor weather conditions. This means we can cover an annual average of up to 70 percent of the island’s power demand with renewables.

In order to reduce the national peak demand of electricity, the main concept of the PEAK SHAVING has to be smarter. This project focuses on the customers and demand management under government&#039;s control interactively.  The system allows the customers to shave their peak and additionally to move their peak, thus managing their demand by using an EMS.

The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.  The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container. The choice for this type of battery also gives the system a long working life, while the batteries can be simply recycled.  The system works using solar energy, wind energy or water energy, but also with conventional energy sources as backup. The great advantage is that the sustainably generated energy is stored in the battery pack, rather than being lost. Due to various management and communication systems being integrated in the SOPRA concept, users can pay in a number of ways, consumption can be regulated and the system can be remote controlled. Alfen supplies the SOPRA concept on a turnkey basis, including the sustainable energy generation, the energy storage, the distribution network, the management and service and maintenance.",1100.0,,,,6.9098333,3.26,,"On-Site Power, ",Ogun State,Ogun State,Nigeria,26.06.2014,,01.01.2015,,,,Cooperative (Customer Owned),,,ALFEN,20.0,,0.0,0.0,,,DD.28.YYYY 23:28:05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Many of these people live in remote areas where it is not technically or economic infeasible to install an electric energy supply. A good solution is to generate the electricity locally using sustainable sources which are abundant in many of the areas in question, in order to establish a local electricity grid. Alfen recently developed the SOPRA system in order to make this possible.  SOPRA stands for Sustainable Off-grid Power Station for Rural Applications and provides for autonomous energy grids at locations where this was not previously feasible. The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.  The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container. The choice for this type of battery also gives the system a long working life, while the batteries can be simply recycled.  The system works using solar energy, wind energy or water energy, but also with conventional energy sources as backup. The great advantage is that the sustainably generated energy is stored in the battery pack, rather than being lost. Due to various management and communication systems being integrated in the SOPRA concept, users can pay in a number of ways, consumption can be regulated and the system can be remote controlled.

1296,Magellan GPSS - SWR ,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery,Operational,"This Grid Power Support System (GPSS) energy storage system was designed specifically for the SWER (Single Wire Earth Return) power transmission system. The SWER power lines are used throughout the world, with the network here in Australia being one of the largest, covering 200,000 km and servicing approximately 100,000 rural customers. The SWER power lines were first utilised after WWII because they offered a simple, low cost power solution by supplying power through a single wire and circulating it back via the earth.  Currently however, the SWER power line network suffers from poor voltage regulation, poor power factor and overload capability.  The GPSS-SWR consists of a single phase rugged IGBT bi-directional inverter, and 100 kWh of Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries. The primary function of GPSS-SWR is voltage regulation, power factor correction, peak current injection (to clear the downstream fuse) and to provide UPS function.

All major car manufacturers have announced to launch an electric vehicle. The Dutch market is expected to expand to 15,000-20,000 EVs in 2013, and 1,000,000 EVs in 2025. The ambition of the Dutch government is to have 200,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020, and a continued growth to a mature market of 1 million vehicles by 2025. For scaling up the number of electric vehicles, a charging infrastructure with 500 fast charging points is essential.  However, anxiety regarding range and finding charging stations can be a major concern for EV drivers; this range anxiety can be alleviated with the availability of fast charging stations at central locations, where a car gets fully charged within 30 minutes. The availability of fast charging stations plays a major role in the acceptance by a broad group of consumers.  An important technical challenge related to electric vehicles is the effect of charging on the classic energy grid. Moreover, the classic energy grid is not suited for fast charging of EVs, as this is accompanied by very high peaks in energy demand. Innovative solutions should be developed to overcome this problem.  MisterGreen aims at developing an important next step for electric transportation: sustainable fast charging stations next to Dutch highway gas stations, where electric cars get fully charged in 30 minutes using solar energy. MisterGreen aims at developing a smart-grid solution – the energy needed for fast-charging is available via energy storage buffer batteries. There will be no peak energy demands on the classic energy grid as these batteries serve as energy buffer. The storage buffer batteries are charged using solar panels. A lack of available solar power can be supplemented by power from the grid.  Mistergreen will realize and manage a nationwide network of fast charging stations at the best locations in the Netherlands. Concessions for twenty highway locations throughout the Netherlands have been obtained until 2027. The fast charging stations will be realized next to gas stations along the highway in the Netherlands.  Intergrated solar panels for onsite electricity generation will charge the batteries of the charging station. Both the battery storage and grid power provide for fast charging the EV.

All major car manufacturers have announced to launch an electric vehicle. The Dutch market is expected to expand to 15,000-20,000 EVs in 2013, and 1,000,000 EVs in 2025. The ambition of the Dutch government is to have 200,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020, and a continued growth to a mature market of 1 million vehicles by 2025. For scaling up the number of electric vehicles, a charging infrastructure with 500 fast charging points is essential.   However, anxiety regarding range and finding charging stations can be a major concern for EV drivers; this range anxiety can be alleviated with the availability of fast charging stations at central locations, where a car gets fully charged within 30 minutes. The availability of fast charging stations plays a major role in the acceptance by a broad group of consumers.  An important technical challenge related to electric vehicles is the effect of charging on the classic energy grid. Moreover, the classic energy grid is not suited for fast charging of EVs, as this is accompanied by very high peaks in energy demand. Innovative solutions should be developed to overcome this problem.  MisterGreen aims at developing an important next step for electric transportation: sustainable fast charging stations next to Dutch highway gas stations, where electric cars get fully charged in 30 minutes using solar energy. MisterGreen aims at developing a smart-grid solution – the energy needed for fast-charging is available via energy storage buffer batteries. There will be no peak energy demands on the classic energy grid as these batteries serve as energy buffer. The storage buffer batteries are charged using solar panels. A lack of available solar power can be supplemented by power from the grid.   Mistergreen will realize and manage a nationwide network of fast charging stations at the best locations in the Netherlands. Concessions for twenty highway locations throughout the Netherlands have been obtained until 2027. The fast charging stations will be realized next to gas stations along the highway in the Netherlands.  Intergrated solar panels for onsite electricity generation will charge the batteries of the charging station. Both the battery storage and grid power provide for fast charging the EV. The battery storage pack will serve as a load-balancing power source and has smart grid functionalities.  At these highway fast charging stations, drivers can fill up their car with sustainable solar energy in less than 30 minutes.

All major car manufacturers have announced to launch an electric vehicle. The Dutch market is expected to expand to 15,000-20,000 EVs in 2013, and 1,000,000 EVs in 2025. The ambition of the Dutch government is to have 200,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020, and a continued growth to a mature market of 1 million vehicles by 2025. For scaling up the number of electric vehicles, a charging infrastructure with 500 fast charging points is essential.  However, anxiety regarding range and finding charging stations can be a major concern for EV drivers; this range anxiety can be alleviated with the availability of fast charging stations at central locations, where a car gets fully charged within 30 minutes. The availability of fast charging stations plays a major role in the acceptance by a broad group of consumers.  An important technical challenge related to electric vehicles is the effect of charging on the classic energy grid. Moreover, the classic energy grid is not suited for fast charging of EVs, as this is accompanied by very high peaks in energy demand. Innovative solutions should be developed to overcome this problem.  MisterGreen aims at developing an important next step for electric transportation: sustainable fast charging stations next to Dutch highway gas stations, where electric cars get fully charged in 30 minutes using solar energy. MisterGreen aims at developing a smart-grid solution – the energy needed for fast-charging is available via energy storage buffer batteries. There will be no peak energy demands on the classic energy grid as these batteries serve as energy buffer. The storage buffer batteries are charged using solar panels. A lack of available solar power can be supplemented by power from the grid.  Mistergreen will realize and manage a nationwide network of fast charging stations at the best locations in the Netherlands. Concessions for twenty highway locations throughout the Netherlands have been obtained until 2027. The fast charging stations will be realized next to gas stations along the highway in the Netherlands.  Intergrated solar panels for onsite electricity generation will charge the batteries of the charging station. Both the battery storage and grid power provide for fast charging the EV.

The demonstration area includes 150 square miles including parts of Columbus, Bexley, Gahanna, New Albany, Whitehall, Reynoldsburg, Westerville, Blacklick, Johnstown, Alexandria, Minerva Park, and Pataskala. This area includes approximately 110,000 meters and 70 distribution circuits. AEP Ohio will implement Smart Grid technology over 58 13kV circuits from 10 distribution stations and 12 34.5kV circuits from six distribution stations. Included in this project is a redistribution management system, integrated volt-VAR control, distribution automation, advanced meter infrastructure, home area networks, community energy storage, sodium sulfur battery storage, and renewable generation sources. These technologies will be combined with two-way consumer communication and information sharing, demand response, dynamic pricing, and consumer products, such as plug-in hybrid vehicles.  The plan was to integrate 80 CES (25kW/25kWh) units of storage resources into the existing grid. After initial testing, AEP Ohio began field installations and commissioned 15 CES units into operations by December 31, 2011. Following this deployment, technical issues were discovered and the CES units were not performing to AEP Ohio’s stringent standards.

These technologies will be integrated into a microgrid that links 1,000 residential meters, 75 commercial meters, and plug-in electric vehicles (PEV). At least 100 of the residential meters will have rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), including 15 or more affordable residences. The project will also integrate 200 residences with smart water and smart irrigation systems. Different storage technologies will be tested including thermal storage, battery technologies (e.g., lithium-ion, lithium iron magnesium phosphate, metal air, and lead acid), and possibly ultracapacitors and fuel cell systems. Distributed generation technologies integrated into the Energy Internet include solar PV (crystalline silicon and thin film), solar water heaters, and absorption chillers. Through the use of Pecan Streets’ two-way energy flow, customers can set electricity and water budgets, have software manage electricity use of individual appliances, and sell energy back to the grid; cars connected to the grid can be powered with solar energy and help level loads; and utilities can store power and deliver it when needed, - See more at: http://www.smartgrid.gov/project/pecan_street_project_inc_energy_internet_demonstration#sthash.i2Mv4MKm.dpuf",15.0,,,,30.395297600000003,-97.74,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, ",Austin,Texas,United States,23.07.2013,,,,ERCOT,Austin Energy,Public Owned,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,DD.21.YYYY 16:21:00,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1594,Tehachapi Wind Energy Storage Project - Southern California Edison,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"&lt;p&gt;The Tehachapi Wind Energy Storage Project, funded by Southern California Edison (SCE) and federal stimulus funding awarded by the Department of Energy as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, is positioned to demonstrate the effectiveness of lithium-ion battery and smart inverter technologies to improve grid performance and assist in the integration of variable energy resources. The project is based at SCE’s Monolith Substation in Tehachapi, California and includes a 32 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) and the associated power conversion system. The project will evaluate the performance of the BESS to improve grid performance and assist in the integration of large-scale variable energy resourced generation. Project performance will be measured with 13 specific operational uses: 1. Provide voltage support and grid stabilization 2. Decrease transmission losses 3. Diminish congestion 4. Increase system reliability 5. Defer transmission investment 6. Optimize size of new renewable-related transmission 7. Provide system capacity and resource adequacy 8. Integrate renewable energy (smoothing) 9. Shift wind generation output 10. Frequency regulation 11. Spin / non-spin replacement reserves 12. Ramp management 13. Energy price arbitrage. Most of the operations either shift other generation resources to meet peak load and other electricity system needs with stored electricity, or resolve grid stability and capacity concerns that result from the interconnection of variable energy resources. SCE will also demonstrate the ability of lithium-ion battery storage to provide nearly instantaneous maximum capacity for supply-side ramp rate control to minimize the need for fossil fuel-powered back-up generation.&lt;/p&gt;",8000.0,,,,35.036143,-118.28,,"Electric Supply Capacity, Renewables Capacity Firming, Transmission Congestion Relief, Transportable Transmission/Distribution Upgrade Deferral, Voltage Support, ",Tehachapi,California,United States,,01.07.2014,01.10.2013,,CAISO,Southern California Edison,Investor Owned,Transmission,Wind,Southern California Edison,0.0,,49956528.0,0.0,National Energy Technology Laboratory,,DD.45.YYYY 22:45:40,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
