The system allows homes and businesses to take their electricity needs entirely off the grid. It represents a major breakthrough in controllable unit technology and is a genuine first-in-the-world solution. The MPS is groundbreaking as it permits up to three simultaneous natural inputs (solar, wind and hydro) with a single inverter – no additional controllers or complicated wiring are required. If natural energy stores are low, the MPS can also charge from the grid at night, storing power in off-peak periods to save the user money. The system achieves incredible efficiency as it has the capability to intelligently control both input and output currents, depending on specific energy needs. It is completely portable, can be retrofitted to existing solar panels, and has a short return on investment timeframe.  NRG Green Co installed a 15 kW inverter mini power system inside the Tanna Island Community Clinic above the battery bank to convert the stored energy into usable 240V AC for use for medical equipment, lights, USB power points etc. This is supplemented by a 1.5 KW scroll type wind turbine.

858,Alcatraz Island Microgrid ,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Advanced Lead-acid Battery,Operational,"The US National Park Service, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US Department of Energy and Princeton Power Systems collaborated to install a commercial scale Microgrid System on Alcatraz Island as a solution to high diesel fuel costs, pollution in the bay area, and high carbon emissions. When a ship’s anchor ruptured the underwater power lines in 1950, that linked the island to San Francisco, Alcatraz was forced to turn to diesel fuel and coal as its source of power. This has led to power costs of $0.76/kWh.   Microgrid Design:  This project reflects the National Park Service’s initiative to find an alternative way of powering the island in order to reduce fuel costs and pollution. A microgrid system, comprised of PPS inverters, a solar array, advanced lead-acid batteries, a PPS Site Controller, and back-up generators, was selected as a way to independently power the island. Designing and building the system on one of California’s and the U.S.’s most well-known historic landmarks with over 1 million visitors per year, created many challenges.   Component Placement: Preserving the island in pristine condition while completing the installation was the greatest challenge. Given that a system of this size requires a large construction effort, component placement was key. To prevent the solar array from being visible from San Francisco, it was placed on the roof of the prison in a flat configuration rather than a traditional angled configuration. The inverters, battery rack, and generators were placed in the old generator room, as this space is isolated and not accessible for tourists. The room was also protected from the harsh salt water environment.  Commissioning: The fragile natural environment and wildlife, particularly the birds (Alcatraz is an old Spanish word for pelican), added to the challenge. Extra attention was given to the solar panels after being damaged by rocks and shells dropped from overhead birds. Despite the coarse condition of the generator room, engineers were able to insulate the room to prevent future problems and ensure reliable long-term operation.",400.0,,,,37.826977500000005,-122.42,,"Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Non-Spinning, Microgrid Capability, Onsite Renewable Generation Shifting, Renewables Capacity Firming, ",San Francisco,California,United States,01.07.2012,30.07.2012,01.08.2012,,,,,,307 kW PV Array,,0.0,$0.71/kWh,3600000.0,0.0,,,DD.20.YYYY 23:20:35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Until this system was introduced, uninterruptable power supply (UPS) systems protected only a single piece of equipment or small group of items. The PQ2000 system detected variations in fupply voltage at the utility interface, adn should the utility voltage exceed the voltage limits (either high or low), the system disconnected from the utility and typically occurred in 8 to 25 ms. The 15 second duration of battery power is sufficicient to correct over 80% of the voltage sags occurring on a typical utility. After the utility returned to normal, the PQ2000 resynchronized with the utility AC-wave form and returned the facility to utility power. A diesel generator backup was added as an option to allow for extended outage protection.  A number of prototype tests were conducted, first by Pacific Gas &amp;amp; Electric&#039;s (PG&amp;amp;E) system test facility in San Ramon, California, then later at a Salt Rivier Project Facility near Phoenix, Arizona, with the support of EPRI.

1241,Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) Battery System,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Lead-acid Battery,De-Commissioned,"The PREPA was a fully commercial battery system that was acquired for daily operation in a frequency control and spinning reserve mode for the island grid of Puerto Rico. The grid had ongoing stability issues, and routinely had frequency and voltage excursions that could only be controlled by aggressive load-shedding, unless new generation was added to provide regulation and stability. The choices for new generation included fast-acting combustion turbines or battery energy storage. PREPA&#039;s analysis showed that battery energy storage systems offered superior operational benefits due to their faster reaction times, both for frequency regulation and spinning reserve requirements.  The comparable slower response times of combustion turbines required more installed capacity, whereas the faster reaction time of a battery system meant that a much smaller battery could offer the same functionality as larger sizes of combustion turbines. Typically, battery systems can reach full operating power in less than 1 second, whereas mechanical systems such as combustion turbines need several seconds to minutes to reach their full power output. The seemingly small difference in reaction times translates into very large consequences for the stability of the electric grid, where events that lead to outages propagate within cycles, and a difference of 1 min translates to a complete blackout under some conditions. Thus, it was shown that battery systems were a more cost effective option compared to combustion turbines because a smaller battery could outperform a much larger block of combustion turbines. This is particularly applicable to an &quot;island&quot; system, where there is no interconnection with a neighboring system to balance the momentary shortage of generation resources during an operational contingency.  The PREPA battery was patterned after the BEWAG battery in application as well as battery type. Valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries were commercially available by the time the PREPA battery project was started, but PREPA chose a flooded, flat-plate cell because it had a proven track record at BEWAG. However, once utility operations began in 1994, the battery was cycled more frequently than planned, which caused the battery to age more rapidly than expected. This use led to positive-plate growth, which caused cell / jar cracks, leaks, short circuits, and ultimately early battery failure.  PREPA made the decision in 2001 to repower, or replace, the battery. A tubular positive plate, flooded battery was selected, and the new battery was installed in mid-2004. Several problems occurred, however, and the system was taken out of service.",20000.0,,,,18.3978052,-66.01,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, Frequency Regulation, Voltage Support, ",San Juan,Puerto Rico,United States,01.01.1989,01.11.1994,01.07.1992,01.12.1999,,Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA),State/Municipal Owned,Primary Distribution,,Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA),0.0,See Sandia&#039;s &quot;Lessons Learned&quot;: http://goo.gl/9YI8t6,20300000.0,0.0,,,DD.08.YYYY 00:08:27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

A lumber mill in Metlakatla (since closed down) caused large, sudden power spikes on the community’s islanded power system, and the BESS was installed to provide fast response for the mill’s rapid load changes.  The MP&amp;amp;L BESS is housed in a purpose-built 40-foot by 70-foot steel butler building that sits on a cement pad. Installation cost of the 1 MW / 1.4 MWh Exide Metlakatla BESS was $1.6 million in 1996 dollars (estimated cost in 2009 dollars: $2.2 million). The battery system became operational in February 1997. It operated continuously for 11.5 years until September 2008, when the battery was replaced with a new VRLA product. The VRLA battery exceeded its 8-year design life by over 3 years. The BESS is estimated to have saved MP&amp;amp;L over $6.5 million over its life in reduced fuel consumption and maintenance, in addition to reduced greenhouse emissions. A new battery was installed with the support of the Alaska Commerce, Community, and Economic Development Agency, so the BESS will continue to provide benefits to the community for many years to come. Spent battery cells will be sent to a lead-acid battery recycling plant in Quebec.",1000.0,,,,55.0845439,-131.58,,"Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, Frequency Regulation, Voltage Support, ",Metlakatla,Alaska,United States,,03.02.1997,,,,Metlakatla Power &amp; Light,Cooperative (Customer Owned),Primary Distribution,,,0.0,"The BESS is estimated to have saved MP&amp;L over $6.5 million over its life in reduced fuel consumption and maintenance, in addition to reduced greenhouse emissions.
