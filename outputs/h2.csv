464,HyBalance - Air Liquide Advanced Business,Hydrogen Storage,Hydrogen Storage,Hydrogen Storage,Operational,"HyBalance is a project that demonstrates the use of hydrogen in energy systems. The hydrogen will be produced from water electrolysis, enabling the storage of low-priced renewable electricity from wind turbines. It will thus help balance the grid, and the renewable hydrogen will be dispensed by hydrogen stations to be used for mobility. Hydrogen will also be used in the industry.  The partners in the HyBalance project are: Air Liquide, Copenhagen Hydrogen Network (CHN), Hydrogenics, Neas Energy, Hydrogen Valley/CEMTEC and Ludwig-Bölkow-Systemtechnik (LBST).    The budget of the project reaches 15 M €, receiving funding from Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking and the Danish ForskEL programme.   Air Liquide is the main investor and project leader of the HyBalance project.   The hydrogen plant is expected to start delivering hydrogen in autumn 2017.
