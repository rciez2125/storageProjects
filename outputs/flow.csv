Coupled with on-site solar PV assets, the system will be used to maximise the university’s utilisation of renewable energy to significantly reduce energy costs for campus buildings. This will generate significant savings for the site and also open up potential new revenue streams, in the form of both contracted and merchant grid services in the future. The system will be used as a ‘flexible platform’ and will become part of the “Monash Microgrid”, in partnership with Monash Energy Materials and Systems Institute (MEMSI).

In 2005, Sumitomo Electric International (Osaka, Japan) was contracted to install a vanadium flow battery system at the existing 30.6 MW Tomamae Wind Villa on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. The primary intent of the battery system is to provide “wind smoothing” for the intermittent and variable wind plant.  The facility has operated well since 5 January 2005, sometimes performing over 50 charge-discharge cycles per hour. By acting as a rapid source and sink for the sometimes highly variable wind energy production, this facility has reduced the ramping rates of the wind farm’s output with respect to the rest of the island’s grid by reducing the peaks and valleys of the wind farm energy output.   The project is located on a Tomamae Town managed stock farm.  Scenery and farm land utilization is preserved by burying the power cables and installing transformers in the turbine towers. The energy storage facility is configured with 16 modules rated at 250 kW each, which gives the entire facility 4 MW with 6 MWh of storage (90 minutes).  Pulse power of 6 MW exists, but only for 20 minutes.  The project was developed and is owned by J-Power, the largest electric utility in Japan.

1436,PacifiCorp Castle Valley VRB,Electro-chemical,Flow Battery,Vanadium Redox Flow Battery,De-Commissioned,"PacifiCorp is a utility based in Portland, Oregon with operations in six Western states. The Castle Valley site was serviced by a 25 kV feeder over 85 miles long, with 209 miles of total line. The length of the feeder led to complaints of low reliability and power quality. In addition, the feeder could not supply any significant amount of new load without causing low voltage to existing customers. Traditional alternatives to add capacity and improve service in this area are costly and environmentally difficult, so that PacifiCorp has sought viable alternatives to meet these goals. The Castle Valley VRB System was built and commissioned for this purpose.  Vanadium redox flow batteries store energy in two electrolytes which are pumped from separate storage tanks across proton exchange membranes in the cell stacks, producing a DC current. The reaction is reversible, so that the battery can be charged and discharged repeatedly with high efficiency. The VRB-ESS™ at Castle Valley was built by VRB Power Systems of Vancouver, British Columbia. The system was sized to provide 250 kW for 8 hours, with a round-trip efficiency when fully operational of between 65% and 80%. The system incorporated a power converter which converts the DC power provided by the battery to AC power during discharge, and vice versa during recharge. The power converter was also capable of providing reactive power compensation and overload capability for short periods of time. The system was commissioned in November 2003, operational in May 2004, and was decommissioned in Spring 2008.",250.0,,,,38.6394278,-109.41,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Castle Valley,Utah,United States,,01.05.2004,01.05.2002,01.03.2008,,Utah Power,Investor Owned,Transmission,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,DD.22.YYYY 17:22:08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Smart Grid, Smart City creates a testing ground for new energy supply technologies.  At least 30,000 households will participate in the project over three years.    The demonstration project gathers information about the benefits and costs of different smart grid technologies in an Australian setting.
