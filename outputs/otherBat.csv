Following testing at its Dolan Technology Center near Columbus, OH, the utility became the first U.S. electric company to deploy NaS batteries in 2002 when it installed and operated a 100 kW / 500 kVA demonstration unit in Gahanna, OH. In 2006, AEP installed a 1.2-MW stationary NaS battery near Charleston, WV. And in 2008, the utility installed three, 2 MW NaS batteries: one in Churubusco, IN.; one in Milton, WV; and one in Bluffton, OH. The 7.2 MW in NaS deployments are part of AEP’s electricity storage strategy that will also include transportable stationary batteries and distributed small scale energy storage systems.  AEP deployed all of its NaS installations as a means to provide load leveling and alleviate transformer loading during summer peaks, defer capital upgrades, and offer emergency backup power to several hundred customers during electrical system outages. Ultimately, the NaS units offer AEP a degree of flexibility in determining the optimal approach for handling reliability problems. The units buy the utility time to decide whether to redesign a substation, build generation, or keep the storage units in place permanently. (All of the NaS systems are capable of being relocated for an estimated $85,000 to $115,000 if and when the company’s needs for storage change.)  AEP’s 2-MW units were deployed in 2008, and are capable of providing islanding (backup power) for over seven hours when loss of utility power from the substation occurs. These newer installations can also perform load-triggered load leveling which, for example, allows the batteries to discharge just enough energy to hold a constrained substation transformer constant. As a result, a greater amount of energy can be reserved for islanding and battery life can be extended due to less frequent discharging.  AEP uses an in-house SCADA system and developed custom software to control all of its batteries based on the loading transformer. The software essentially creates a feedback loop where the load of the transformer is compared to a desired maximum, and the battery output is then adjusted to achieve that maximum.  In addition, the unit sited at the Balls Gap substation in Milton, WV successfully islanded approximately 700 customers for roughly 30 minutes during a simulated outage staged on July 8, 2009. A live islanding event, meanwhile, took place in December 2009, during a snowstorm that islanded 25 customers for two days. Over that period, the Milton installation was able to minimize disruptions; customers experienced less than three minutes of continuous disruption during the two-day outage period.  Finally, on October 20, 2009, the Milton, WV battery was successfully operated to alleviate load and voltage concerns during a load transfer event between substations. While the transformer at one station was taken out of service for maintenance, load was transferred to a different station which caused voltage and loading concerns. The Milton battery was deployed and mitigated these concerns.

In the event of a generation or transmission related outage, it can provide 27 megawatts of power for 15 minutes. That&#039;s enough time for the co-op to start up local generation when there are problems with the Intertie or power plants in Anchorage.  One of the requirements for construction of the Intertie was a reactive power supply capable of delivering power should generation fail. At the heart of the world&#039;s most powerful energy storage battery are two core components: the Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cad) batteries, developed by Saft, and the converter, designed and supplied by ABB. The converter changes the batteries&#039; DC power into AC power ready for use in GVEA&#039;s transmission system.  Awards Received:  - ABB was awarded the Platts 2003 Global Energy Award for their design and development of the BESS converter. - The Electric Power Resarch Institue Technology Award for the BESS project at the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association Annual Meeting on February 15 2004. - Guiness World Record certificate acknowledging that the BESS is the world&#039;s most powerful battery on December 10, 2003.

The island of Tilos is currently supplied with oil-based generated electricity via an undersea cable from the island of Kos. Its annual electricity consumption is in the order of 3 GWh and its peak demand, during summetime, reaches approximately 1 MW. The existence of the undersea cable allows for the investigation of the interplay between an interconnector and energy storage, and of energy trade strategies between a smart microgrid (Tilos island) and a macrogrid (the electricity system of Kos).   In this context, the main objective of TILOS is the development and operation of a prototype battery storage system, based on NaNiCl2 batteries, that will be provided with a smart grid control system and that will cope with the challenge of supporting multiple tasks. These tasks range from microgrid energy management, maximization of RES penetration and grid stability, to export of guaranteed energy and provision of ancillary services to the main grid of Kos.

Due to passing clouds, solar energy output was observed to rapidly fluctuate; cases were observed where over 80% of a solar unit&#039;s output would drop in less than five seconds.  This rapid fluctuation in circuit power flows can cause undesirable voltage conditions that are significant for existing infrastructure to correct. To solve this, a battery system was envisioned that charged and discharged to absorb the solar-induced &quot;power swings&quot;, allowing the circuit&#039;s voltage profile to remain smooth despite significant and rapid changes to the power flows along it.   Duke has arranged 12 batteries manufactured by the Italian company FIAMM for use in series in hybrid electric buses to make a 402-kilowatt battery. It is used to smooth out large minute-by-minute spikes and troughs in production from the 1.2-megawatt rooftop solar project Duke operates about a mile away.
