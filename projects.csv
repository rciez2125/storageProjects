Dulles TES Tank for Internet Service Provider,Thermal Storage,Chilled Water Thermal Storage,Chilled Water Thermal Storage,Operational,"In 2006, a large Internet Service Provider (ISP) located in Dulles, VA selected DN Tanks to build a mission critical Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tank to service their data center. The data center which operates 24 hours each day could not afford the consequences that would result if their chilled water cooling system were to experience downtime. This TES tank, now our third built TES tank for this same ISP, was designed to provide back-up cooling for the central plant in the event that the chillers experience unexpected downtime.  The engineer for the project, Dunlap &amp;amp; Partners, designed the revisions to the chilled water system which included the addition of a new TES tank. The tank was specified to be capable of storing enough chilled water equal to the peak cooling load for the facility for a period of two hours. In addition, the chilled water pressure drop through the tank was specified to stay below 3 psi even in the event that the pumps were to require a delivery flow rater of 5,184 gpm which is the maximum flow rate to the building.  Poole &amp;amp; Kent, the mechanical contractor, provided the new chilled water piping, pumps, and valves in addition to overseeing the installation of this TES tank. DN Tanks together with Poole &amp;amp; Kent worked closely with the owner and engineers in ensuring that the TES system was constructed within the agreed upon schedule, and commissioned expeditiously so that the data center would be protected with this reservoir of chilled water.  In August of 2007, representatives of the owner, the mechanical contractor, the engineer, and DN Tanks commissioned the TES system. The commissioning process included shutting down all chillers during the middle of a weekday of the data center operation. Immediately upon shutting down the chillers, the new TES system was energized and chilled water from the TES tank became the sole source of cooling for the facility.

"Yokohama Smart City Project, SCADA Virtual Battery",Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"The Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) is an effort to develop a model for smart cities by means of cooperation between citizens, private companies, and the municipality, and to export the successful model to Japan and the rest of the world. Large-scale operational experiments are being held with Yokohama. The hierarchical bundling of energy management systems (EMS) enables energy management at the level of individual EMS and demand-side management at the level of the overall system.  One of the most unique undertakings of the Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) is the storage battery SCADA. SCADA stands for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition and is a device monitoring and control system. The storage battery SCADA uses multiple storage batteries as one massive virtual battery to control battery charging and discharging. This type of system is nearly unprecedented anywhere in the world, and creating the system has made it possible to achieve moderated demand response (DR).  Participating in the project are Toshiba Corporation, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Incorporated, Hitachi, Ltd., Meidensha Corporation, NEC Corporation, Sharp Corporation, and Sony Energy Devices Corporation.                              Two types of batteries are controlled by the storage battery SCADA: large batteries used to adjust electric power supply and demand; and stationary batteries used in homes, commercial buildings, and so on. The batteries used for supply and demand adjustments are lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Toshiba (300 kW), Hitachi (100 kW), and NEC and Meidensha Corporation through joint development (200 kW), providing total output of 600 kW. Batteries designed for users were installed in homes and commercial buildings by Sony Energy Devices, and batteries for office buildings in Yokohama were installed by Sharp. The storage battery SCADA performs three types of functions to control these batteries: daily operation, short-cycle supply and demand adjustment, and reserve power operation. The moderated DR mentioned above is achieved by daily operation. Specifically, the storage battery SCADA sends inquiries to home and commercial building users about their spare battery capacity on the following day. The responses received indicate how much spare capacity is available and when, as well as indicating that operations of a certain type are planned for a specific time, and therefore the remaining capacity may be used freely. Based on these responses, the storage battery SCADA borrows the spare capacity of user batteries and charges the batteries from the power grid at times when power demand is relatively low. The power company estimates the shortfall in electric power compared to the amount of power needed at peak times based on daily demand forecasts and supply plans. The storage battery SCADA receives requests from the power company, gathers spare battery capacity equal to the amount of the shortfall, and stores power. In addition, when sending inquiries about spare capacity to users, the system also asks how much the users want to be paid per kilowatt hour as an incentive (payment is made for capacity actually used in 30-minute increments). The storage battery SCADA selects batteries in homes and commercial buildings up to the required storage capacity starting with the lowest incentives. In this way, the electric power company can provide the necessary power by discharging batteries when electricity supply and demand is tight. The second function, short-cycle supply and demand adjustment, is a method of using supply and demand adjustment batteries to make up for the shortfall in short-cycle adjustment capacity provided by thermal electricity generation and hydroelectric power resulting from the introduction of renewable energy, which is subject to output fluctuations. Load frequency control is performed. The third function, reserve power operation, discharges supply and demand adjustment batteries during emergencies such as when an accident occurs to the power grid in order to minimize the effects of the accident.",600,35,140,,"Electric Bill Management, Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, ",Yokohama,Kanagawa,Japan,27.03.2014,,,,N/A,Tokyo Electric Power Corporation,,,,,0,N/A,0,0,,,DD.16.YYYY 21:16:10,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

GM E-Motor Charging Station &amp; Microgrid,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"General Motors, OnStar and TimberRock Energy Solutions have collaborated to deploy an advanced, solar microgrid at GM’s E-Motor Plant in White Marsh, Maryland. The objective of the project was to quantify how a microgrid comprised of distributed energy resources (DERs) that include solar PV, EV charging infrastructure, stationary li-ion energy storage and a ﬂeet of Chevy Volts could deliver an economic “beneﬁt stack” sufﬁcient to enable scalable, microgrid business models.  The project tightly integrates the performance of the various DERs within the microgrid via TimberRock’s Distributed Energy Resources Management System (DERMS) called De-MAP. De-MAP serves as the integration platform for both the DERs and the external management systems. The DERs are aggregated and managed as a single block of capacity allowing them to “straddle the meter” and be dispatched to deliver value to both the host site – delivering cost-effective energy and reducing demand charges – and the grid by providing services like frequency regulation.  The project represents the ﬁrst commercial deployment of OnStar’s Smart Grid solutions which allows EVs to be integrated with a microgrid and directly managed as grid-interactive resources.

However, during periods when the demand for electricity is low (such as evenings, weekends, or during seasonal fluctuations), the dam can use its excess power generating capacity to pump water back into the reservoir—enhancing reservoir capacity and storing water for periods when the demand for electricity is high. At the time it was constructed, the Aldeadávila Dam had the largest pumping station in Europe.   The Aldeadávila Dam has two diversion tunnels, each 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in length. Each tunnel has a 53-metre (174 ft) high surge tank. The dam also contains more than 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of tunnels which divert water to the electrical generation turbines. There are six penstock tunnels, each about 5 metres (16 ft) in diameter. The design of the penstocks and auxiliary spillways using these tunnels has proved to be an issue, however. Cavitation problems have damaged these tunnels in the past. Until the Alcantara Dam was built in 1969, the Aldeadávila Dam was the largest hydroelectric power plant in Europe.

Tanbara Pumped Hydro Power Station,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"Tamahara Dam (玉原ダム) is a rock-fill embankment dam on a Tone River tributary in Gunma Prefecture of Japan. It is located 14 km (9 mi) north of Numata. It creates the upper reservoir for the 1,200 MW Tamahara Pumped Storage Power Station (玉原発電所). Construction began in 1973 and the dam was complete in 1981 while the power station was commissioned in 1986. It is 116 m (381 ft) tall and withholds a reservoir with a storage capacity of 14,800,000 m3 (11,999 acre·ft). Of that capacity, 13,000,000 m3 (10,539 acre·ft) is active (or useful) for power generation. The lower reservoir for the pumped-storage power station is created by the Fujiwara Dam, located 4 km (2 mi) to the northwest on another Tone River tributary. Power is generated during periods of high energy demand and pumping occurs during times when energy demand is low such as at night. The power station contains four 300 MW reversible Francis turbine pump-generators which serve to both pump water and generate electricity. The upper Tamahara Reservoir is at an elevation of 1,177 m (3,862 ft) and the lower Fujiwara Reservoir is at 651 m (2,136 ft) which affords the power station an effective hydraulic head of 518 m (1,699 ft). When pumping, the pump-generators can move up to 210 m3/s (7,416 cu ft/s) of water and when generating, they discharge up to 276 m3/s (9,747 cu ft/s).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamahara_Dam  http://www.jepic.or.jp/en/data/EPIJJapanData.pdf  http://www.suiryoku.com/gallery/gunma/tanbara/tanbara.html",1200000,36.7862665,139.16,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Tone-gun,Gunma Prefecture,Japan,,01.01.1982,,,N/A,,Investor Owned,,,,0,,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Web2Energy Smart Grid Project ,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"Project objectives Three pillars of Smart Grids in distribution systems The project Web2Energy is directed to implement and approve all three pillars of &quot;Smart Distribution&quot;.  1. Smart Metering – the consumer participates in the energy market A few hundred electricity consumers in the supply area of HSE AG will be obtained with smart meters. These advanced meters provide many innovative functions:  Remote reading of metered values in short term intervals, Reception and visualization of price signals (variable rates) Disturbance signals and management of failures Estimation of manipulations and stolen energy Permanent meter data storage and monitoring of load profiles Supervision and control of distributed power producer, storage and controllable loads Furthermore, they provide gateways to monitor the current demand with the related costs and to further functions of building automation and in-house energy management (smart home). Variable (up to hourly) rates are offered to the clients. Current rates, the rate forecasts and the current demand are monitored. The consumer gets the opportunity to control his demand regarding non time critical loads in accordance with the offered rates. The project Web2Energy is able to achieve experiences with such a practice. The advanced meter technology comes from Landis + Gyr Austria.  2. Smart  Energy Management – Clustering of small power producers  A large number of small independent power producers are supervised and coordinated in such a way that at each moment a scheduled power feeds into the distribution network in accordance with the current demand or the request from the market. Consequently, the deviation of fluctuating wind or solar power from the predictions can be compensated in real-time through the aggregation with controllable generators, loads and storage in the framework of a virtual power plant (VPP). Inside the supply area of the HSE AG this coordination will be applied with benefits. Parallel with a number of volatile of wind power and photovoltaic plants a large number controllable hydro and thermo power plants with cogeneration of heat and power (CHP), storage and controllable industrial loads are in operation. They are able to contribute to the generation and load management. The central operated VPP participates on the markets for energy and control power and optimizes the operations and the overall power in-feed. In this way all participants can achieve higher efficiency and higher compensation of their expenses in comparison with the single market access. To support the VPP operations advanced storage technologies will be established. The EUS GmbH Dortmund implements the VPP procedures. The Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) contributes its experience of market access.  3. Smart Distribution Automation – higher reliability of supply Today supply interruptions happen very rarely. When they do occur, they are caused by 96% in the medium (MV)-/low (LV) voltage distribution networks. In the case of a disturbance an inspection team has to drive along the MV/LV-terminals for disturbance allocation and supply recovery by switching operations. These procedures take on average 1 hour or more. The Web2Energy project implements an automated sequence to execute the former manual processes in a selected area of the HSE AG. This approach cuts the supply interruption down to minutes. Consequently, the very high reliability of supply in Germany will be significantly improved. The necessary control technology comes from iPLS (PL).  Linking the users: All three pillars of smart distribution require the information exchange between the users of the network like consumers, producers, terminals, control centre of the network operator, traders and VPP.  Communication channels have to cover also the last meters to these participants.",5,49.8776483,8.65,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, ",Darmstadt,Hesse,Germany,10.09.2013,,,,N/A,HSE AG,,,,,0,,0,0,,,DD.44.YYYY 17:44:30,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It draws its energy from the force of the tide by using a tidal barrage. Instead of damming water on one side like a conventional dam, a tidal barrage first allows water to flow into a bay or river during high tide, and releasing the water back during low tide. This is done by measuring the tidal flow and controlling the sluice gates at key times of the tidal cycle. Turbines are then placed at these sluices to capture the energy as the water flows in and out.  The station&#039;s 24 reversible bulb pump-turbines are used to pump water into the river basin at high tide (for ebb generation). This energy is more than returned during generation, because power output is strongly related to the head. If water is raised 2 ft (61 cm) by pumping on a high tide of 10 ft (3 m), this will have been raised by 12 ft (3.7 m) at low tide. The cost of a 2 ft rise is returned by the benefits of a 12 ft rise.

It is a construction with daily water accumulation that participates in the functioning of the frequency regulation and of the distribution of electricity to the grid. This hydraulic structure consists of four parts: an upper and a lower reservoir, penstocks and a power station. The lower reservoir was created by means of damming up the valley of the Čierny Váh by a 375 m long dam. Its capacity is 5.1 million m3. The level fluctuates by 7.45 m between elevations 726.00 – 733.45 m. The upper reservoir of an irregular shape is situated between the valleys of the Biely Váh and the Čierny Váh. It has a maximum capacity of 3.7 million m3 of water and the level fluctuates by 25 m between the elevation points 1160 – 1135 m above sea level. The sealing of the slopes and of the bottom is provided by one layer of asphalt concrete sealing blanket with a surface of approximately 200,000 m2. Underneath the reservoir, there is an inspection tunnel that should collect the potential seepages from the reservoir bottom and slopes. The hydraulic connection of the upper and lower reservoir is ensured via three pressure penstocks which have an internal diameter of 3.8 m. In the valley, they split into pipes that transport the water to the two turbines and outlets of water from the two accumulation pumps. The maximum head between the upper and the lower reservoirs is 434 m. The lower reservoir dam includes also a power station with a control room. There are six pumping turbo aggregates installed that comprise a motor generator, a Francis turbine and an accumulation pump. When 6 accumulation pumps are in operation, it takes 8 hours to pump the water into the upper reservoir.

The scheme was originally built by BAC in 1896 and was the first large-scale commercial hydro-electric scheme in the UK, used to power an aluminium smelter also located here until this closed in 1967. BAC created a reservoir by joining two small lochs to form Loch Mhor, which lies 179 m above Loch Ness and 2 miles away.  During the redevelopment, a 5 MW turbine was installed in the original power station building to replace the original plant and provide pure hydro-electric generation, while the tunnels and pipes which carried the water were reused. The River Fechlin was diverted into Loch Mhor to provide additional water and, to support the pumped-storage system, new tunnels and a further power station were built.  A new power station was built to house two 150 MW Francis generation-motor sets, each weighing 914 tonnes, with 5 m wide turbine blades. 100 cubic meters of water pass through each turbine and out into the loch every second during generation. The turbines can be brought from a standstill to full power output in less than two minutes, which makes the station extremely responsive to demand. The new scheme became fully operational in 1975.

Tumut Hydroelectric Power Station 3,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"Tumut 3 Power Station is the first pumped storage hydroelectric power station in Australia. Pump-storage schemes use off-peak energy to pump water to a reservoir on a higher level. This water then passes through turbines to generate electricity when prices are higher. The sole powerhouse is located above ground, approximately 1,800 metres (5,900 ft) below Talbingo Dam.   The power station is fitted with six Toshiba turbines, three of which are reversible pump-turbines. All six turbines are equipped with Melco-manufactured generators, and they have a combined generating capacity of 1,500 megawatts (2,000,000 hp) of electricity.   The power station was completed in 1973, and has 150.9 metres (495 ft) rated head. Water is pumped through six pipelines, each 488 metres (1,601 ft) long and 5.6 metres (18 ft) in diameter, delivering water to Talbingo Reservoir.   During 2003, Snowy Hydro commissioned six 140 kilowatts (190 hp) micro-hydro generators on the existing cooling water systems on each of the six generating units at Tumut 3 Power Station. These GreenPower accredited units enable Snowy Hydro to save approximately 3,137 tonnes (3,458 short tons) of carbon dioxide per annum. In addition, this installation not only captures previous wasted renewable energy, but also will be substantially reducing the noise that was associated with the previous pressure reducing valves on the six generating unit&#039;s cooling systems.

Burbank Buena Vista Library #2 - Ice Energy,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energy’s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how – and more importantly when – energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites. When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.",8,34.1641362,-118.33,,"Electric Bill Management, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Burbank,California,United States,02.03.2015,,,,N/A,Burbank Water &amp; Power,Public Owned,,,Ice Energy,0,N/A,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Caterva SWARM,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"For the first time: Frequency Containment Reserve by privately used swarm of Energy Storage Systems  -	Successful pre-qualification as part of the SWARM pilot project  -	A contribution to the stabilization of the European power transmission grid system    On 20 July 2015, pre-qualification was for the first time obtained for a network of privately used solar Energy Storage Systems (ESS) for supply of Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) in Germany. As a result, 65 ESS in the SWARM pilot project were allowed to immediately contribute to stabilization of the power grid. The joint project by the technology and system supplier, Caterva GmbH, and by the Nuremberg community utility N-ERGIE Aktiengesellschaft, is supported by a grant of the State of Bavaria. Siemens AG is a technology partner.  The special feature of the large-scale virtual storage system is the networking of the storage units of household size. The ESS feature lithium-ion storage batteries. Siemens delivers the power electronics system.  Each ESS is provided with its own control unit, so that it can react on a stand-alone basis to grid frequency. The ESS, installed in private households, are connected via the UMTS network, with the control center at Caterva, which coordinates the households as a swarm. The control center acquires the latest individual data on storage-charging levels of the ESS and regulates the swarm such that the FCR, also known as frequency regulation or balancing power, on offer is actually available. At the TenneT control station, the data are forwarded online. The N-ERGIE power plant control station is responsible 24 by 7 for operator control and supervision of the large-scale virtual storage system, as it is for its own power generating facilities.   Double benefits for households  The beneficiaries of the ESS developed by Caterva – each with a total output rating of 20 kW and a capacity of 21 kWh – are the operators of private roof-top PV installations. Thanks to the storage systems, these users can cover 60 to 80 % of their power requirements from their own solar systems – and can at the same time contribute to German energy transition (Energiewende) by providing balancing power.  As a result of the considerably larger storage-battery capacity of the ESS in comparison to conventional PV buffer-storage, participation in the FCR market means no restriction to users in the consumption of the energy that they themselves have generated.   The first 65 ESS installations are distributed throughout the entire distribution system area of N-ERGIE, which is over 8,000 km² in size.   Contribution to grid stability  With provision of positive and negative FCR, the swarm enhances grid stability. Power balancing is necessary to compensate for the imbalance in power generation and consumption in such a way that grid frequency remains constant at 50 hertz. Balancing power is provided by transmission system operators in three specifications: FCR, Frequency Restoration Reserve, and Replacement Reserve (minute balancing power).  Demands placed on FCR are the strictest, since it must be provided within 30 seconds. Before Restoration and Replacement Reserve power, FCR is supplied directly proportionally to the deviation of grid frequency by each ESS.   Swarm Energy Storage Systems satisfy strictest requirements  The ESS swarm system has impressively fulfilled all requirements.

Santa Paula 1 - Western Grid Development LLC,Electro-chemical,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"SCE’s 5-megawatt lithium-ion system from developer Western Grid comes with only a three-year contract term, mainly because its future energy capacity has already been spoken for, via a contract award last year to help SCE meet requirements set under California’s broader energy storage mandate, which requires the state’s big three utilities to procure 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage by decade’s end.  That contract, like the others under SCE’s 2014 Energy Storage request for offers, calls for Western Grid to have the battery up and running by 2020. But with the new proposal, the two are planning to speed up that deployment, with the proposed contract serving as a bridge agreement for the intervening three years.   The system is designed to provide four hours of discharge at the stated capacity, thus providing resource adequacy (RA) for the 5 MW of contract capacity throughout the term of the Santa Paula 1 Contract.

Seattle City Light Microgrid,Electro-chemical,Electro-chemical,Electro-chemical,Announced,"Seattle City Light will use a grant to help develop a microgrid, which will include a utility-scale battery system, solar panels and emergency generators located at a designated emergency shelter, such as a community center. During normal operations, the solar panels will charge the batteries and provide some of the power to operate the building. When the solar panels are not generating, the batteries can back up the delivery of electricity from Seattle City Light’s distribution grid or, during periods of high demand, could be used to reduce the amount of energy the utility has to purchase to meet customer needs, holding down costs for all its customer-owners. After a storm, earthquake or other emergency, the solar panels, emergency generators and battery system can power a portion of the building even if damage to the distribution grid causes outages in the surrounding area.  “Microgrids show promise for providing backup power during outages, increasing our community’s resiliency after a disaster and making it easier to integrate renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind,” comments Larry Weis, Seattle City Light’s general manager and CEO.  The specific location for the micorgrid has yet to be determined, but Seattle City Light will create a microgrid at a designated emergency shelter, powered by solar energy. During an emergency, this stand-alone power grid will keep fire stations, community centers and communication networks operating.   http://www.seattle.gov/documents/departments/parksandrecreation/briefingpapers/solar%20resiliency%20microgrid%20presentation7.13.pdf",0,47.6062095,-122.33,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Microgrid Capability, Renewables Energy Time Shift, Resiliency, ",Seattle,Washington,United States,18.08.2016,,,,N/A,,Public Owned,,Solar PV,,0,,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tanna Island Renewable Energy Community,Electro-chemical,Valve Regulated Lead-acid Battery,Valve Regulated Lead-acid Battery,Operational,"Green NRG Co designs and manufactures the Mini Power System (MPS), a renewable energy generation and storage system which enables users to generate, store and consume their own clean, free energy. The system allows homes and businesses to take their electricity needs entirely off the grid. It represents a major breakthrough in controllable unit technology and is a genuine first-in-the-world solution. The MPS is groundbreaking as it permits up to three simultaneous natural inputs (solar, wind and hydro) with a single inverter – no additional controllers or complicated wiring are required. If natural energy stores are low, the MPS can also charge from the grid at night, storing power in off-peak periods to save the user money. The system achieves incredible efficiency as it has the capability to intelligently control both input and output currents, depending on specific energy needs. It is completely portable, can be retrofitted to existing solar panels, and has a short return on investment timeframe.

The district will install solar and DemandLogic™, SolarCity&#039;s smart energy storage system for businesses, to generate and store its own clean, renewable electricity at eight schools. DemandLogic will allow the district schools to reduce energy costs by using stored electricity to lower peak demand. SolarCity will install the district&#039;s solar systems and advanced battery technology at eight elementary and middle schools, as well as additional solar generation at a district office. The solar installations will total more than 1.4 megawatts of clean power capacity, with storage providing an additional 360 kilowatts (720 kilowatt hours) of power to reduce peak demand. The new solar systems are expected to save the district more than $1 million dollars over the life of the contracts, and the DemandLogic battery storage systems could save thousands more on demand charges each year. Burton School District retained TerraVerde Renewable Partners, an independent energy advisor, to assess and scope an optimal energy cost savings program, analyze financing options, organize the RFP process and help the district select the best candidate to meet the program&#039;s specifications. The new SolarCity systems are expected to generate 2.3 million kilowatt hours of solar energy annually, and enough over the life of the contract to power more than 4,000 homes for a year. The solar systems will also help avoid more than 43 million pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and save more than 203 million gallons of water*, an especially important environmental benefit in the drought-stricken valley.

Win Inertia designed and installed the system under a contract with the Spanish government&#039;s Administrator of Railway Infrastructures (ADIF). In this installation, the system also enables ADIF to store excess energy in a battery bank that supplies an electric vehicle (EV) charging station located at the rail station. The facility also seamlessly integrated a photovoltaic (PV) generator to supply additional energy if required.  The recuperation system employs Win Inertia&#039;s SHAD® hybrid control technology (international patent pending) to integrate batteries and Maxwell ultracapacitors to increase energy recovery efficiency and reduce stress on the batteries, thereby extending battery life. Ultracapacitors&#039; rapid charge/discharge characteristics uniquely enable them to capture and store more energy during each braking event than battery-based systems, which have limited ability to absorb energy in the few seconds required to stop a vehicle. Win Inertia&#039;s high-efficiency hybrid energy storage and power delivery system furthers ADIF&#039;s return on investment as it enables dual use of the recuperated energy for rail vehicle propulsion and EV charging.

The new technology allows to maintain momentary power balance more efficiently.  KPX said the new technology will provide benefits of improving operation of electric power systems and creating new businesses as it allows thermal power plants to reduce cost factors in regulating frequency.  And, it will enable power generation companies to minimize high-cost LNG-fired power generation by increasing use of low-cost power generation, while avoiding construction of additional power plants needed for securing power reserves. It will also reduce emission of pollutant (yellow plume) and allow companies to reduce consumption of high-priced batteries thanks to ESS-based short cycle service.  Moreover, it will enable low cost power plant, which is in output cutback operation to regulate frequency, to conduct fixed output operation by 100% by storing power of electric power systems in ESSs when frequency rises and discharging stored power when frequency drops. It is analyzed that companies will be able to drastically reduce power generation costs in this way.

When a ship’s anchor ruptured the underwater power lines in 1950, that linked the island to San Francisco, Alcatraz was forced to turn to diesel fuel and coal as its source of power. This has led to power costs of $0.76/kWh.   Microgrid Design:  This project reflects the National Park Service’s initiative to find an alternative way of powering the island in order to reduce fuel costs and pollution. A microgrid system, comprised of PPS inverters, a solar array, advanced lead-acid batteries, a PPS Site Controller, and back-up generators, was selected as a way to independently power the island. Designing and building the system on one of California’s and the U.S.’s most well-known historic landmarks with over 1 million visitors per year, created many challenges.   Component Placement: Preserving the island in pristine condition while completing the installation was the greatest challenge. Given that a system of this size requires a large construction effort, component placement was key. To prevent the solar array from being visible from San Francisco, it was placed on the roof of the prison in a flat configuration rather than a traditional angled configuration. The inverters, battery rack, and generators were placed in the old generator room, as this space is isolated and not accessible for tourists. The room was also protected from the harsh salt water environment.  Commissioning: The fragile natural environment and wildlife, particularly the birds (Alcatraz is an old Spanish word for pelican), added to the challenge. Extra attention was given to the solar panels after being damaged by rocks and shells dropped from overhead birds. Despite the coarse condition of the generator room, engineers were able to insulate the room to prevent future problems and ensure reliable long-term operation.",400,37.8269775,-122.42,,"Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Non-Spinning, Microgrid Capability, Onsite Renewable Generation Shifting, Renewables Capacity Firming, ",San Francisco,California,United States,01.07.2012,30.07.2012,01.08.2012,,N/A,,,,307 kW PV Array,,0,$0.71/kWh,3600000,0,,,DD.20.YYYY 23:20:35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

164 W. Magnolia - Ice Energy,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energy’s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how – and more importantly when – energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites. When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.",8,34.1780047,-118.32,,"Electric Bill Management, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Burbank,California,United States,,23.09.2013,,,N/A,Burbank Water &amp;amp; Power,Public Owned,,,Ice Energy,20,N/A,0,0,,,DD.39.YYYY 17:39:17,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pennsylvania ATLAS (Aggregated Transactive Load Asset),Thermal Storage,Heat Thermal Storage,Heat Thermal Storage,Operational,"VCharge, recognizing the energy storage potential of ETS, developed electronic controls for these heating systems that allow individual heaters or electric boilers to be switched on or off rapidly (within seconds) of the receipt of a control signal by VCharge’s Network Operations Center from the area’s grid operator, PJM Interconnect. The innovation started in the tidy development of Stones Throw in East Stroudsburg, where developers had installed identical ETS units in the 1980′s and ’90s, making it a perfect place to pilot VCharge’s technology. Now, over 40 Stones Throw homeowners, and nearly another 100 in the surrounding area, have installed free controls on their ETS heaters to participate in this radical experiment in grid storage and energy management–and to get a 25% discount on their home heating bills.  By itself, any individual heating system is relatively unremarkable. But together, the 134 homes in VCharge’s Aggregated Transactive Load Asset (ATLAS) create a huge resource for grid balancing–specifically providing ancillary services like fast frequency response through the markets run by PJM.

Tomamae Wind Farm ,Electro-chemical,Flow Battery,Vanadium Redox Flow Battery,Operational,"The Tomamae Wind Villa Power Plant continues to be one of the world’s largest vanadium redox flow battery energy storage installations and, at the time of commissioning in 2000, was Japan’s first and largest wind power plant. In 2005, Sumitomo Electric International (Osaka, Japan) was contracted to install a vanadium flow battery system at the existing 30.6 MW Tomamae Wind Villa on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. The primary intent of the battery system is to provide “wind smoothing” for the intermittent and variable wind plant.  The facility has operated well since 5 January 2005, sometimes performing over 50 charge-discharge cycles per hour. By acting as a rapid source and sink for the sometimes highly variable wind energy production, this facility has reduced the ramping rates of the wind farm’s output with respect to the rest of the island’s grid by reducing the peaks and valleys of the wind farm energy output.   The project is located on a Tomamae Town managed stock farm.  Scenery and farm land utilization is preserved by burying the power cables and installing transformers in the turbine towers. The energy storage facility is configured with 16 modules rated at 250 kW each, which gives the entire facility 4 MW with 6 MWh of storage (90 minutes).  Pulse power of 6 MW exists, but only for 20 minutes.  The project was developed and is owned by J-Power, the largest electric utility in Japan. While moving into wind generation, J-Power produces most of it’s electricity from coal-fired and hydroelectric power plants. Other J-Power wind generation projects include the 65.98 MW Koriyama Nunobiki-kogen Wind Power Plant, 24.75 MW Nikaho Highland Wind Project, 21 MW Green Power  Kuzumaki Wind Farm, and the 22 MW J-Wind Tahara plants.",4000,44.3060399,141.65,,"Onsite Renewable Generation Shifting, Renewables Capacity Firming, Renewables Energy Time Shift, ",Tomamae,Hokkaido,Japan,,01.01.2005,,,N/A,Hokkaido Electric Power Company,Investor Owned,Transmission,30.6 MW Wind Farm,,0,,0,0,,,DD.00.YYYY 19:00:29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No matter how many wind turbines or photovoltaic power plants are added to the grid, the lion’s share of the electricity supply has to be produced by diesel generators.  To break this dependence on diesel fuel, intelligent power controls and a purpose-built Energy Management System make the current grid independent of conventional generators, whose rotating mass now sets the pace. The new system combines software with a 6 MW / 3.2 MWh battery storage system, a 4.5 megawatt wind park and a 1 megawatt photovoltaic power plant.  The new, hybrid power system on Graciosa can immediately use up to 100 percent sun and wind power. The diesel generators will only be needed for back-up in weeks with very poor weather conditions. This means we can cover an annual average of up to 70 percent of the island’s power demand with renewables.

Opened by the Queen in October 1965, it is one of four pumped storage power schemes in the UK, and has the distinction of being the world&#039;s first high head reversible pumped-storage hydro scheme. The station has also been used as the setting for several films, including the James Bond film The World is not Enough.  Nicknamed The Hollow Mountain, Cruachan was constructed between 1959 and 1954 and is unique in that the station is concealed within the hollowed out rock of Ben Cruachan, 3,694 feet (1,126 m), which overlooks the visitor centre. It was conceived and designed by Sir Edward MacColl, a Scottish engineer and a pioneer of hydro electricity in Scotland, with numerous projects to his credit. The only visible features are the dam, which is 1,000 feet (316 m) wide and located 1,300 feet (390 m) up the mountain, and the station offices and visitor centre, which lie on the loch side below the dam, and next to the road.

The energy storage system, which has the capacity to store approximately 800kWh (kilowatt hour) nominal, 500kWh normal usage, consists of two 40ft containers for the batteries and a 40ft container for the power conditioning system. Each battery container houses more than 2,000 units of lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and its management system. The power conditioning system container houses a system for conversion of direct current (DC)/alternating current (A/C) and the associated input/output controls.  The energy storage system will be installed at SHEPD&#039;s Kirkwall Power Station. In the cases of power shortage or power surplus on the Orkney Islands, power is transmitted from/to the mainland through two 33kV submarine cables. When there is too much renewable energy, exceeding the export capacity of the cable to the mainland, the energy storage system will import part of the excess energy, reducing the need to constrain renewable generation on the islands, by reducing or stopping generator export.&quot;   http://www.all-energy.co.uk/__novadocuments/86694?v=635673060322170000",2000,58.984674,-2.96,,"Transmission Congestion Relief, ",Kirkwall,Orkney,United Kingdom,01.11.2012,01.06.2013,,,SHEPD,,,,,,3,,0,0,,,DD.13.YYYY 17:13:35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

AEP Milton NaS Battery Energy Storage System,Electro-chemical,Sodium based Battery,Sodium-sulfur Battery,Operational,"AEP has pioneered the use of NaS batteries in the United States. Following testing at its Dolan Technology Center near Columbus, OH, the utility became the first U.S. electric company to deploy NaS batteries in 2002 when it installed and operated a 100 kW / 500 kVA demonstration unit in Gahanna, OH. In 2006, AEP installed a 1.2-MW stationary NaS battery near Charleston, WV. And in 2008, the utility installed three, 2 MW NaS batteries: one in Churubusco, IN.; one in Milton, WV; and one in Bluffton, OH. The 7.2 MW in NaS deployments are part of AEP’s electricity storage strategy that will also include transportable stationary batteries and distributed small scale energy storage systems.  AEP deployed all of its NaS installations as a means to provide load leveling and alleviate transformer loading during summer peaks, defer capital upgrades, and offer emergency backup power to several hundred customers during electrical system outages. Ultimately, the NaS units offer AEP a degree of flexibility in determining the optimal approach for handling reliability problems. The units buy the utility time to decide whether to redesign a substation, build generation, or keep the storage units in place permanently. (All of the NaS systems are capable of being relocated for an estimated $85,000 to $115,000 if and when the company’s needs for storage change.)  AEP’s 2-MW units were deployed in 2008, and are capable of providing islanding (backup power) for over seven hours when loss of utility power from the substation occurs. These newer installations can also perform load-triggered load leveling which, for example, allows the batteries to discharge just enough energy to hold a constrained substation transformer constant. As a result, a greater amount of energy can be reserved for islanding and battery life can be extended due to less frequent discharging.  AEP uses an in-house SCADA system and developed custom software to control all of its batteries based on the loading transformer. The software essentially creates a feedback loop where the load of the transformer is compared to a desired maximum, and the battery output is then adjusted to achieve that maximum.  In addition, the unit sited at the Balls Gap substation in Milton, WV successfully islanded approximately 700 customers for roughly 30 minutes during a simulated outage staged on July 8, 2009. A live islanding event, meanwhile, took place in December 2009, during a snowstorm that islanded 25 customers for two days. Over that period, the Milton installation was able to minimize disruptions; customers experienced less than three minutes of continuous disruption during the two-day outage period.  Finally, on October 20, 2009, the Milton, WV battery was successfully operated to alleviate load and voltage concerns during a load transfer event between substations. While the transformer at one station was taken out of service for maintenance, load was transferred to a different station which caused voltage and loading concerns. The Milton battery was deployed and mitigated these concerns.

Following testing at its Dolan Technology Center near Columbus, OH, the utility became the first U.S. electric company to deploy NaS batteries in 2002 when it installed and operated a 100kW/500kVA demonstration unit in Gahanna, OH. In 2006, AEP installed a 1.2-MW stationary NaS battery near Charleston, WV. And in 2008, the utility installed three, 2-MW NaS batteries: one in Churubusco, IN.; one in Milton, WV; and one in Bluffton, OH. The 7.2 MW in NaS deployments are part of AEP’s electricity storage strategy that will also include transportable stationary batteries and distributed small scale energy storage systems.  AEP deployed all of its NaS installations as a means to provide load leveling and alleviate transformer loading during summer peaks, defer capital upgrades, and offer emergency backup power to several hundred customers during electrical system outages. Ultimately, the NaS units offer AEP a degree of flexibility in determining the optimal approach for handling reliability problems. The units buy the utility time to decide whether to redesign a substation, build generation, or keep the storage units in place permanently. (All of the NaS systems are capable of being relocated for an estimated $85,000 to $115,000 if and when the company’s needs for storage change.)  AEP’s 2-MW units were deployed in 2008, and are capable of providing islanding (backup power) for over seven hours when loss of utility power from the substation occurs. These newer installations can also perform load-triggered load leveling which, for example, allows the batteries to discharge just enough energy to hold a constrained substation transformer constant. As a result, a greater amount of energy can be reserved for islanding and battery life can be extended due to less frequent discharging.  AEP uses an in-house SCADA system and developed custom software to control all of its batteries based on the loading transformer. The software essentially creates a feedback loop where the load of the transformer is compared to a desired maximum, and the battery output is then adjusted to achieve that maximum.

Lewiston Pump-Generating Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Niagara project, located about 4 1/2 miles downstream from the Falls, consists of two main facilities: the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant, with 13 turbines, and the Lewiston Pump-Generating Plant, with 12 pump-turbines. In between the two plants is a forebay capable of holding about 740 million gallons of water; behind the Lewiston plant, a 1,900-acre, 22 billion gallon reservoir holds additional supplies of this liquid fuel.  Water is diverted from the Niagara River—up to 375,000 gallons a second—and conveyed through conduits under the City of Niagara Falls to Lewiston. From there, water flowing through the Robert Moses plant spins turbines that power generators, converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy.  At night, when electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units operate as pumps, transporting water from the forebay up to the plant&#039;s reservoir.  During the daytime, when electricity use peaks, the Lewiston pumps are reversed and become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant. In this way, the water can be used to produce electricity twice, increasing production and efficiency.  To balance the need for power with a desire to preserve the beauty of Niagara Falls, the United States and Canada signed a treaty in 1950 that regulates the amount of water diverted for hydroelectricity production. On average, more than 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), or 1.5 million gallons of water a second, flow from Lake Erie into the Niagara River. The 1950 pact requires that at least 100,000 cfs of water spill over the Falls during the daylight hours in the tourist season, April through October.

Holway which was built on Saline Creek and the lower reservoir is Lake Hudson on the Grand River. During periods of lower power demand, water is pumped from Lake Hudson to Lake Holway and released back down through the pump-generators during periods of high energy demand.  The project was constructed in two stages:  Stage 1 consisted of building an earth and rock filled dam in Chimney Rock Hollow 185 feet (56 m) high, creating Chimney Rock Reservoir. A canal 1,850 feet (560 m) long led from the dam to a forebay structure that had openings for steel penstocks,each 14 feet (4.3 m) in diameter. Three penstocks led from the forebay to a powerhouse that housed three 64,000 horsepower pump-generators, with a total rated capacity of 130 megawatts. This stage was completed in 1968.  Stage 2 comprised building three more penstocks, extending the powerhouse and adding three more pump-generators, all identical to those installed in Stage 1.

Solid State Batteries for Grid-Scale Energy Storage,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,De-Commissioned,"Seeo and its partners are demonstrating a large-scale prototype of a solid-state polymer electrolyte lithium-ion rechargeable battery for use in Smart Grid energy storage applications. Seeo seeks to validate this technology to address the needs of Community Energy Storage Systems—small (less than 100 kW) distributed energy storage systems alongside padmounted and pole-mounted transformers. The 25kWh battery pack is more than a 50% improvement in weight and energy density; has 10-15+ year operating life with 3,000-5,000 or more cycles; has no volatile or flammable components; and will be 35% cheaper than existing lithium-ion batteries. This approach allows independent control over mechanical and electrical properties. Seeo’s cell design couples a solid lithium metal anode with a conventional porous lithium iron phosphate cathode yielding a pouch cell energy density of 235 Wh/kg and 410 Wh/l. The cell can withstand temperatures as high as 150°C and voltages of 10 volts without incident. An independent analysis of the environmental and economic impact of battery improvement will also be conducted.  Goals/Objectives • Develop and deploy a prototype battery system that validates Seeo’s technology • Reduce the cost of battery cells by $100-$300/kWh • Improve battery installation and maintenance • Produce a plan for manufacturing and commercializing the technology at utility scale  Key Milestones • Polymer temperature and voltage assessment complete (September 2011) • Produce a total of 1,000 cells with optimized power and energy (December 2011) • Finalize Pack Design (June 2012) • Prototype pack assembly complete (January 2013) • Complete prototype pack performance testing and validation (September 2013)  PROJECT DURATION: 07/30/10–07/29/2014",100,37.6688205,-122.08,,"Grid-Connected Commercial (Reliability &amp; Quality), Grid-Connected Residential (Reliability), ",Hayward,California,United States,,30.07.2010,,29.07.2014,CAISO,,,,,"Seeo, Inc.",0,https://www.smartgrid.gov/files/Seeo_SolidStateBatteries_FTR_DE-OE0000223_0.pdf,12393122,0,UC Berkeley,,DD.11.YYYY 19:11:20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

JC Penney Headquarters - Calmac,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"CALMAC’s technology has proven its versatility to reduce operating costs since the tanks were installed in 1991. However, today the energy landscape in Texas is vastly different from 25 years ago. JCPenney is currently faced with a ratcheted demand charge from its utility as well as coincident peak charge, which make up a large portion of the company’s monthly utility bill.  With the ratcheted demand pricing, the month with the highest energy usage sets the annual peak demand charge. In 2013, the annual peak demand charge was set in August at $37,479. The charge is ratcheted at 80 percent, which means that for the 11 months following August, JCPenney pays a demand charge of $29,983 (80 percent of $37,479). This applies unless a new peak demand is set, in which case the process starts over.   The other significant demand charge that JCPenney’s Headquarters incurs is called a Transmission Cost Recovery Factor, also known as a 4CP or coincident peak demand charge. The 4CP is determined by averaging a customer’s demand during the highest grid-wide peak hours of peak demand in each of the four summer months, June through September.

Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) Battery System,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Lead-acid Battery,De-Commissioned,"The PREPA was a fully commercial battery system that was acquired for daily operation in a frequency control and spinning reserve mode for the island grid of Puerto Rico. The grid had ongoing stability issues, and routinely had frequency and voltage excursions that could only be controlled by aggressive load-shedding, unless new generation was added to provide regulation and stability. The choices for new generation included fast-acting combustion turbines or battery energy storage. PREPA&#039;s analysis showed that battery energy storage systems offered superior operational benefits due to their faster reaction times, both for frequency regulation and spinning reserve requirements.  The comparable slower response times of combustion turbines required more installed capacity, whereas the faster reaction time of a battery system meant that a much smaller battery could offer the same functionality as larger sizes of combustion turbines. Typically, battery systems can reach full operating power in less than 1 second, whereas mechanical systems such as combustion turbines need several seconds to minutes to reach their full power output. The seemingly small difference in reaction times translates into very large consequences for the stability of the electric grid, where events that lead to outages propagate within cycles, and a difference of 1 min translates to a complete blackout under some conditions. Thus, it was shown that battery systems were a more cost effective option compared to combustion turbines because a smaller battery could outperform a much larger block of combustion turbines. This is particularly applicable to an &quot;island&quot; system, where there is no interconnection with a neighboring system to balance the momentary shortage of generation resources during an operational contingency.  The PREPA battery was patterned after the BEWAG battery in application as well as battery type. Valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries were commercially available by the time the PREPA battery project was started, but PREPA chose a flooded, flat-plate cell because it had a proven track record at BEWAG. However, once utility operations began in 1994, the battery was cycled more frequently than planned, which caused the battery to age more rapidly than expected. This use led to positive-plate growth, which caused cell / jar cracks, leaks, short circuits, and ultimately early battery failure.  PREPA made the decision in 2001 to repower, or replace, the battery. A tubular positive plate, flooded battery was selected, and the new battery was installed in mid-2004. Several problems occurred, however, and the system was taken out of service.",20000,18.3978052,-66.01,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, Frequency Regulation, Voltage Support, ",San Juan,Puerto Rico,United States,01.01.1989,01.11.1994,01.07.1992,01.12.1999,N/A,Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA),State/Municipal Owned,Primary Distribution,,Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA),0,See Sandia&#039;s &quot;Lessons Learned&quot;: http://goo.gl/9YI8t6,20300000,0,,,DD.08.YYYY 00:08:27,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

SOPRA: Food-processing factory Sustainable Powerplant,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery,Operational,"Alfen recently developed the Sustainable Off-grid Power Station for Rural Applications (SOPRA) which provides for autonomous energy grids at locations where this was not previously feasible. The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.  The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container. The choice for this type of battery also gives the system a long working life, while the batteries can be simply recycled.  The system works using solar energy, wind energy or water energy, but also with conventional energy sources as backup. The great advantage is that the sustainably generated energy is stored in the battery pack, rather than being lost. Due to various management and communication systems being integrated in the SOPRA concept, users can pay in a number of ways, consumption can be regulated and the system can be remote controlled.

Many of these people live in remote areas where it is not technically or economic infeasible to install an electric energy supply. A good solution is to generate the electricity locally using sustainable sources which are abundant in many of the areas in question, in order to establish a local electricity grid. Alfen recently developed the SOPRA system in order to make this possible.  SOPRA stands for Sustainable Off-grid Power Station for Rural Applications and provides for autonomous energy grids at locations where this was not previously feasible. The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.  The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container. The choice for this type of battery also gives the system a long working life, while the batteries can be simply recycled.  The system works using solar energy, wind energy or water energy, but also with conventional energy sources as backup. The great advantage is that the sustainably generated energy is stored in the battery pack, rather than being lost. Due to various management and communication systems being integrated in the SOPRA concept, users can pay in a number of ways, consumption can be regulated and the system can be remote controlled.

SOPRA Zero Watt project,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery,Operational,"Alfen recently developed the Sustainable Off-grid Power Station for Rural Applications (SOPRA) system which provides for autonomous energy grids at locations where this was not previously feasible. The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.  The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container.

Ice Energy project at 950 Twin View Blvd,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energy’s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how – and more importantly when – energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites. When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.",20,41,0,,"Electric Supply Capacity, Electric Bill Management, ",Redding,California,United States,,05.12.2013,,,N/A,Redding Electric Utility (REU),Public Owned,,,Ice Energy,20,N/A,0,0,,,DD.33.YYYY 18:33:34,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The ambition of the Dutch government is to have 200,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020, and a continued growth to a mature market of 1 million vehicles by 2025. For scaling up the number of electric vehicles, a charging infrastructure with 500 fast charging points is essential.  However, anxiety regarding range and finding charging stations can be a major concern for EV drivers; this range anxiety can be alleviated with the availability of fast charging stations at central locations, where a car gets fully charged within 30 minutes. The availability of fast charging stations plays a major role in the acceptance by a broad group of consumers.  An important technical challenge related to electric vehicles is the effect of charging on the classic energy grid. Moreover, the classic energy grid is not suited for fast charging of EVs, as this is accompanied by very high peaks in energy demand.

Štěchovice Pumped Hydro Station,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Štěchovice Hydro Power Station was built between 1938 and 1947. The concrete dam with granite revetment is 22.5 m high and 120 m long. This waterworks includes a lock chamber, which overcomes the difference of 19.10 m between the lower and upper water levels and is unique in Europe, and also the reservoir of the pumped-storage power station Homole with a total capacity of 0.5 million m3, and two steel penstock shafts of 1.7 to 2 m diameter and length 590 m. The medium-head part of the power station with 2 Kaplan turbines with total installed capacity of 22.5 MW (2x11.25 MW) was commissioned in 1944. The pumped-storage power station was initially built between 1941 and 1947. After many years of intensive exploitation, it was shut down in 1991 and reconstructed between 1991 and 1996. Instead of two sets arranged in three stages of total capacity of 42 MW it is now equipped with a single set of a reversing Francis turbine and a motor generator, which give a total capacity of 220 MWh. The set is installed in an underground generator room built in a pit which is approximately 45 m high. The power station includes also two outdoor switching stations, 110 kV and 22 kV. Both parts of the power station are fully automatic and are controlled remotely from the Control Room of the Vltava Cascade.   The Štěchovice water reservoir was built between 1938 and 1944. The concrete dam with a granite revetment is 22.5 m high and 120 m long, with five spillways with crest gates. These spillways with the capacity of 2,400 m3/s are able to handle floods as catastrophic as the one in 1890.

Malta Main Stage Pumped Storage Power Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"In the 1930s, Allgemeinen Elektricitätsgesellschaft (AEG) and Alpen-Elektrowerke AG (AEW) developed projects for power plants near Malta. Plans of the Österreichische Bundesbahnen followed after 1945. In 1952, Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG (ÖDK) carried out water and energy-related tests and created a plan for the utilisation of the Malta and Gößbäche with a three-stage power plant group. A dissertation written in 1956 at the technical university in Graz by Erich Magnet with the title &quot;Winter Storage Plant Inner Maltatal-Kolbnitz&quot; was used by Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG and proved to be very important for the development of the project.  The water rights negotiations for the Malta upper stage and Malta main stage power plants took place in 1964. The approval of the water authorities was granted in 1965. Heavy protests, especially from the Austrian Society for Nature Conservation, followed when the project area lost its nature conservation status. The conservationists called for the erection of nuclear power stations as an alternative to storage power plants. The detailed planning commenced in 1971 following the positive construction decision.  In addition to covering demand peaks, it was required that the power plant group Malta must, at all times, be in a position to provide reserve power for a failed nuclear power plant. The earlier-than-expected issuing of the building decision and the new requirements created major challenges for the planning and construction departments. In addition, the first machine unit for the main stage was to be commissioned two years earlier than expected on 1 December 1978. The planning was carried out, inter alia, by Construction Director Kurt Baustädter, Rudolf Mußnig, Kurt Landl, Heiner Ludescher and Georg Lichtenegger from Draukraftwerke AG. External planners, such as the civil technology company Ehß, were also engaged. The architectural work was carried out by Rudolf Nitsch from Klagenfurt.  After a series of geological tests, the final location for Rottau power plant was fixed in 1973. The excavation pit reached a depth of approximately 30 metres below the valley basin and 25 metres below the groundwater level. Extensive safety measures were necessary to prevent the penetration of groundwater. The first machine unit was commissioned in Rottau power plant in late autumn 1976. The storage pumps were commissioned in summer 1978. The capacity of 730,000 kW corresponds to the capacity Zwentendorf nuclear power plant would have had.",730000,46.87241,13.33,,"Black Start, ",Rottau,Carynthia,Austria,,01.01.1979,,,N/A,,,,,Allgemeinen Elektricitätsgesellschaft (AEG) and Alpen-Elektrowerke AG (AEW),0,,0,0,,,DD.08.YYYY 19:08:30,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Kaprun Upper Stage Pumped Storage Power Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"History of the Power Plant  The initial planning for the power plant facilities in the Kaprun Valley date back to the &quot;centralisation project&quot; of the Allgemeine Elektricitätsgesellschaft (AEG) Berlin [General Power Company]. The planned pooling of all the water from the Hohe Tauern into the Kaprun Valley was interrupted due to the outbreak of the global economic crisis at the beginning of the 1930&#039;s. With Austria&#039;s annexation to the German Reich in the spring of 1938, the project was once again made a high priority and re-designed under the head of the newly founded Alpen Elektrowerke AG (AEW [Alpine Power Company]), Hermann Grengg. The new plans contemplated a two stage pumped storage power plant with an upper storage reservoir on the Mooserboden and Wasserfallboden storage lakes above the Limberg Alp. The construction work began with the construction of new and expansion of existing access roads to the construction sites, in particular to the Kapruner Winkel [Kaprun Corner], the building site of the Hauptstufe [main stage] power house, and to the Limberg Alp. When the war ended, the Hauptstufe power house and a makeshift dam on the Wasserfallboden were ready for operation.  Construction of the Oberstufe [upper stage] power house could not begin, however until completion of the Limberg dam, which was to connect airside to the new structure. In the final phase of the work on the barrier, more and more attention was given to the archtectonic design of the Limberg power house. To this end, an invitation to tender was held to design of the crown of dam and powerhouse with architect Harald Bauer&#039;s design being selected. For the power house however, the third-placed architect Edith Lassmann&#039;s design was selected.  The contract was awarded at the beginning of 1951 and the excavation work for the power house to be attached to the nearly completed dam began immediately thereafter. Between May and August 1951 alone, around 10,000 m³ of rock was removed from the area of the foundations for the new power house. The construction materials were transported via a tow-railway from the Bruck/Fusch station to the Kapruner Winkel and from there taken to the Limberg site with a cement cable railway.  In 1953 the construction work on the main structure was completed. Construction on the stilling basin continued until June 1954 since the final form was not set until after extensive studies and model tests had been carried out by the planning department of Tauernkraftwerke AG.  The first machine set was commissioned on 14 November 1954, the second on1 December 1955. Both of the Möll connecting bridge pumps in the pump cave next to the Drossensperre retaining wall followed on 28 May 1956.  The barracks, equipment and auxiliary cable railway set up for the construction of the dams and power house were removed after construction was completed.",113000,47.3648489,12.64,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Limberg,Salzburg,Austria,,01.01.1956,,,N/A,,,,,,0,,0,0,,,DD.56.YYYY 20:56:32,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The building has no direct anchoring to the rock of the slope behind it. Hydraulic cushioning is built into the ground floor and the first floor on the mountain side to prevent any carryover of tension - a construction method that was developed based on experience gained in the construction of the Roßhag power house. The roof of the machine hall is connected to the slope by means of an anchor and gutter beam that can be walked on that can be used to channel water from the slope and roof to the drainage canal via a drop shaft.  The buildings are made of coated in situ concrete using prefabricated concrete elements in the area of the roof edges.  The machine hall has a concrete ribbed floor and a light coating on the inside.

Roßhag Pumped Storage Power Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"History of the Power Plant  Since Roßhag power plant is located in an avalanche-prone area, it was necessary for the entire construction to be carried out with appropriately solid material, whereby the construction elements are able to withstand a pressure of 20 to 50 t/m². A total of ten deep borehole explosions had to be carried out in the excavation of the construction pit. The building is in paint-ready, in-situ concrete, supplemented by prefabricated concrete units, executed and divided into three blocks of roughly equal lengths by means of expansion joints. The roof over the machinery hall comprises prefabricated, reinforced concrete components. The uphill-facing distribution lines were embedded in a solid concrete block.  Strain was nevertheless caused by the encasing in concrete of the pumps and turbine coils, as well as the firm anchoring of the building with the rock. In the surface construction, pillars were covered with concrete at intervals of some 6 m and connected via two 8 or 15 m reinforced concrete girders that lay across the operating floor. The lower girder is connected to the rock by means of high tensile bars; the upper girder serves for slope stabilisation and simultaneously forms the uphill support for the roofing slab. The flat roofs are landscaped with vegetation. The concrete surfaces have a light-coloured interior coating; the floors of the machinery hall and the upper part of the walls are clad with red clinker slabs. The closures are designed as armoured doors.",231000,47.0867914,11.77,,"Renewables Capacity Firming, Renewables Energy Time Shift, ",Kraftwerk Roßhag,Tyrol,Austria,,01.01.1972,,,N/A,,,,,,0,,0,0,,,DD.55.YYYY 20:55:48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Malta Upper Stage Pumped Storage Power Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"History of the Power Plant  The first plans for the energy-technical utilisation of the waters at the upper end of the Malta Valley, which is known for its extremely high precipitation levels, date back to the 1930s. The decision by Österreichische Draukraftwerke AG (ÖDK) to construct the three-stage Malta power plant, however, did not follow until 1957. The power plants comprise an upper stage with Kölnbrein reservoir and Galgenbichl power house, the main stage with Galgenbichl reservoir in the upper Malta valley between Gamskarnock and Lausnock, the main stage power house in Rottau near Kolbnitz in the Möll valley as well as the lower stage with a diversion channel in the Möll valley and Möllbrücke power house in the Drau valley.  Given that it had only been established for a short time, ÖDK did not, however, have the financial resources necessary to construct the Reißeck, Kreuzeck and Malta power plants at the same time. For this reason, detailed planning did not commence until 1961 following the completion of the Reißeck-Kreuzeck power plants. In 1965, the Malta-Upper Stage and Malta-Main Stage projects were approved by the water authorities.  The construction work for Galgenbichl power house followed after commencement of work on the Kölnbrein Dam and the Galgenbichl reservoir. The construction warehouse was extended in April 1974 and work on the development of the construction site commenced. Machinery and equipment from the neighbouring construction site at Galgenbichl Dam were used during the construction period.  The excavation work commenced in the east section of the power house, and due to the tight time schedule, continued through winter 1974/75. The work to stabilise the 40-metre cliff to the west of the power house to which parts of the building are attached proved to be a major challenge. An external firm was commissioned to supply and prepare 800 tons of twisted ribbed steel so as to save time by working parallel. In spite of weather-related delays, work on the assembly of the first machine commenced on 1 September 1975 and the assembly of the second machine followed in 1976.  The power house was handed over to ÖDK on 1 September 1976.

PacifiCorp Castle Valley VRB,Electro-chemical,Flow Battery,Vanadium Redox Flow Battery,De-Commissioned,"PacifiCorp is a utility based in Portland, Oregon with operations in six Western states. The Castle Valley site was serviced by a 25 kV feeder over 85 miles long, with 209 miles of total line. The length of the feeder led to complaints of low reliability and power quality. In addition, the feeder could not supply any significant amount of new load without causing low voltage to existing customers. Traditional alternatives to add capacity and improve service in this area are costly and environmentally difficult, so that PacifiCorp has sought viable alternatives to meet these goals. The Castle Valley VRB System was built and commissioned for this purpose.  Vanadium redox flow batteries store energy in two electrolytes which are pumped from separate storage tanks across proton exchange membranes in the cell stacks, producing a DC current. The reaction is reversible, so that the battery can be charged and discharged repeatedly with high efficiency. The VRB-ESS™ at Castle Valley was built by VRB Power Systems of Vancouver, British Columbia. The system was sized to provide 250 kW for 8 hours, with a round-trip efficiency when fully operational of between 65% and 80%. The system incorporated a power converter which converts the DC power provided by the battery to AC power during discharge, and vice versa during recharge. The power converter was also capable of providing reactive power compensation and overload capability for short periods of time. The system was commissioned in November 2003, operational in May 2004, and was decommissioned in Spring 2008.",250,38.6394278,-109.41,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Castle Valley,Utah,United States,,01.05.2004,01.05.2002,01.03.2008,N/A,Utah Power,Investor Owned,Transmission,,,0,,0,0,,,DD.22.YYYY 17:22:08,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The demonstration area includes 150 square miles including parts of Columbus, Bexley, Gahanna, New Albany, Whitehall, Reynoldsburg, Westerville, Blacklick, Johnstown, Alexandria, Minerva Park, and Pataskala. This area includes approximately 110,000 meters and 70 distribution circuits. AEP Ohio will implement Smart Grid technology over 58 13kV circuits from 10 distribution stations and 12 34.5kV circuits from six distribution stations. Included in this project is a redistribution management system, integrated volt-VAR control, distribution automation, advanced meter infrastructure, home area networks, community energy storage, sodium sulfur battery storage, and renewable generation sources. These technologies will be combined with two-way consumer communication and information sharing, demand response, dynamic pricing, and consumer products, such as plug-in hybrid vehicles.  The plan was to integrate 80 CES (25kW/25kWh) units of storage resources into the existing grid. After initial testing, AEP Ohio began field installations and commissioned 15 CES units into operations by December 31, 2011. Following this deployment, technical issues were discovered and the CES units were not performing to AEP Ohio’s stringent standards. The CES units were removed from the field and returned to S&amp;amp;C. This component of the project has been redefined to include a limited deployment of four CES units at an outdoor test environment on AEP Ohio property to continue extensive testing.

Reisseck II Pumped Storage Power Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"Through the construction of the pumped storage power plant Reisseck II, VERBUND is not only investing in the expansion of renewable energies but - in connection with the existing power plants Malta and Reisseck - is also creating one of Europe&#039;s most efficient hydropower plant groups in Carinthia&#039;s Möll Valley.  The high Alpine project area for the pumped storage power plant Reisseck II is located in Mühldorfer Graben at a height of up to 2,300 metres (m) where the Great Mühldorfer Lake will later function as an upper basin. The cavern power plant Reisseck II will be erected 1,585 m above sea level in the mountain and equipped with two powerful pump turbines.  Similar to a normal storage power plant, Reisseck II will produce peak electricity in high demand periods, whereby water will be transported via a works water channel from Great Mühldorfer Lake to the two turbines that drive the generators. The processed water will run into a lower basin.  Both of the machines units in the mountain can be switched to pump operation, whereby the generators will then function as motors and the turbines will pump the water from the lower basin back up to the upper basin. Pump operation will take place during the day when the European grid is carrying more electricity than is required by the consumers. Energy which, for example, comes from the large wind farms or the Danube power plants can be saved in the form of pumped-up water. The pumped storage power plant Reisseck II will therefore function as a &quot;green battery&quot; in the Alps. The power plant will have a capacity of 430 megawatt (MW), both in turbine and pump operation. This corresponds to the electricity generating capacity of approximately 200 wind turbines.  On completion of the rock cavern for the power plant in 2011, the boring of the works water channel to Great Mühldorfer Lake commenced in the first half of 2012 with an 880-ton (t) and 220 m tunnel boring machine. The assembly work on Austria&#039;s largest power plant construction site commenced in summer 2012. 300 experts are currently working on this high Alpine site. The newest VERBUND pumped storage power plant Reisseck II will be commissioned in 2014. The total investment volume amounts to € 385 million.  A 200-ton transformer works its way up to Reisseck power plant  In the project Reisseck II, assembly work is going full speed ahead. Of all power plant components, the block transformer with a tare weight of 200 tons is the heaviest single component.  The transformer was delivered to Spittal on the river Drau by rail.

Ludington Pumped Storage,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Ludington Pumped Storage Plant sits on a 1,000-acre site along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The plant was built between 1969-73 and is jointly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison, and operated by Consumers Energy. The plant contributes directly to local governments about $11 million in annual property taxes.  Revenue from plant operations, maintenance and overhauls also contribute significant sums to the local economy.  Local residents still refer to the plant as “The Project”.  One of the world’s biggest electric “batteries”, Ludington can provide energy at a moment’s notice. Its ability lies in its 27-billion gallon reservoir and a set of six turbines that drive electric generators.  Those same turbines double as giant water pumps to fill the reservoir with water from Lake Michigan. At night, when electric demand is low, Ludington’s reversible turbines pump water 363 feet uphill from Lake Michigan. The water is pumped through six large pipes, or “penstocks”, to the 842-acre reservoir. During the day, when electric demand is high, the reservoir releases water to flow downhill through the penstocks. The flowing water turns turbines and generators in the powerhouse to make electricity. The plant can generate up to 1,872 megawatts — enough electricity to serve a community of 1.4 million residential customers. The output is more than double the capacity of any single unit on Consumers Energy’s system. Ludington’s relatively simple technology enables the plant to respond quickly to the daily, weekly and seasonal highs and lows of Michigan’s energy demand. The plant also saves customers money by enabling Consumers Energy to avoid the expensive spot market when customer demand exceeds the capacity of the company’s baseload plants.

Bad Creek Pumped Hydro Storage,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Bad Creek Hydroelectric Station is a 1,065-megawatt pumped-storage facility located in Oconee County, eight miles north of Salem, S.C. The four-unit station began generating electricity in 1991, and is the largest hydroelectric station on the Duke Energy system. It is named for the two streams, Bad Creek and West Bad Creek, which were dammed to create the Bad Creek reservoir.  The Bad Creek facility utilizes two reservoirs (or lakes) to generate electricity: an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir. Water stored in an upper lake is released into underground power tunnels. The water rushes down the tunnels, driving huge turbines, which are underground at the base of a dam. The spinning turbines are connected to large generators, which produce the electricity. The water then flows through draft tubes into a lower lake.  A pumped-storage hydroelectric station uses the same water over and over again, making more efficient use of water resources. When demand for electricity is low, operators can refill the lake, as if they were “recharging” a battery. Using power from other generating stations, the generators act as electric motors spinning the huge turbines backward. This pumps water back up the power tunnels into the upper lake. Water is generally pumped back to the upper reservoir at night and on weekends.  With the reservoir at full-pond elevation and generating with all four units, Bad Creek can generate for 24 hours within its maximum 160’ drawdown. Full pond elevation is 2310 MSL (Mean Sea Level).",1065000,35.010984,-83.01,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, ",Oconee County,South Carolina,United States,,01.01.1991,,,N/A,Duke Energy,Investor Owned,Transmission,,,0,Performance metrics not available.,0,0,,,DD.40.YYYY 17:40:49,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The pumped-storage hydroelectric plant, operated by the AmerenUE electric company, was designed to help meet peak power demands during the day. Electrical generators are turned by water flowing from a reservoir on top of Proffit Mountain into a lower reservoir on the East Fork of the Black River. The generators and turbines at river level are reversible, and at night the excess electricity available on the power grid is used to pump water back to the mountaintop.  The Taum Sauk plant is notable in that it is a pure pump-back operation – there is no natural primary flow available for generation, unlike most other pumped storage sites. It was among the largest such projects when it was built. Construction of the Taum Sauk plant began in 1960 and operation began in 1963.

New Waddell Dam Pumped Hydro Storage,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"Construction of New Waddell Dam began in 1985, and continued through 1994. New Waddell Dam&#039;s primary purpose is to store Colorado River water for CAP use. The dam also stores Agua Fria River runoff and provides flood protection by controlling river flows. The dam is located one-half mile downstream of historic Waddell Dam, which was built by the Maricopa Water District (MWD). The dam&#039;s reservoir, Lake Pleasant, also stores water for MWD irrigation.  In the winter, Colorado River water is pumped uphill from the CAP aqueduct into Lake Pleasant when power rates are low. In the summer, when demand for water and electricity increases, water is released through the Pump-Generating plant, producing hydroelectric power that is sold to help repay the CAP&#039;s construction costs. In addition, New Waddell Dam adds 7,000 surface acres to the lake, greatly increasing the recreational value of Lake Pleasant Regional Park.  Handicapped-accessible recreational facilities include 3 multiple-lane boat ramps, 450 picnic sites, 225 campsites, 14 group use areas, 4 overlooks, a full-service marina equipped to handle 1000 boats, and 7 miles of trail. Because the reservoir water level may fluctuate up to 125 feet during a typical year&#039;s operation, the facilities will be located to be accessible during both high and low water periods.  If necessary, floodwaters can be released from the dam through the river outlet works tunnel into the Agua Fria River immediately below the dam. If the reservoir&#039;s flood storage capacity is ever exceeded, water can also be released over spillways located west of the dam. This water would flow down Morgan City Wash and back to the Agua Fria River about one mile below the dam.  The cost of constructing New Waddell Dam was more than $625 million.

Helms Pumped Hydro Storage Project,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The power plant operates by moving water between two reservoirs, an upper and a lower. When energy demand is high, water is released from the upper reservoir to the plant where electricity is generated before the water is discharged into the lower reservoir. When demand is low at times such as night, water is then pumped back up to the upper reservoir to be used as stored energy for a later time. This is accomplished by pump-generators which serve a dual role as both pumps which can reverse into generators.

John W. Keys III Pump-Generating Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The John W. Keys III Pump-Generating Plant (formerly known as Grand Coulee Pump-Generating Plant) pumps water uphill 280 feet from Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake to Banks Lake. This water is used to irrigate approximately 670,000 acres of farmland in the Columbia Basin Project. More than 60 crops are grown in the basin and distributed across the nation  Construction of the irrigation facilities began in 1948. Components of the project include the pump-generating plant, feeder canal, and equalizing reservoir, which was later named Banks Lake. Banks Lake was formed by damming the northern 27 miles of the Grand Coulee, and has an active storage capacity of 715,000 acre-feet. The lake stores water for irrigation and also provides important recreational benefits to the region. The pump-generating plant began operation in 1951. From 1951 to 1953, six pumping units, each rated at 65,000 horsepower and with a capacity to pump 1,600 cubic feet per second, were installed in the plant.   In the early 1960s, investigations revealed the potential for power generation. Reversible pumps were installed to allow water from Banks Lake to flow back through the units to generate power during periods of peak demand. The first three generating pumps came online in 1973. Two more generating pumps were installed in 1983; the final generating pump was installed in January 1984. The total generating capacity of the plant is now 314,000 kilowatts. In 2008, the pump-generating plant was renamed in honor of John W. Keys III. Keys was Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation from 2001 to 2006 and Pacific Northwest Regional Director from 1986 to 1998.

Metlakatla BESS,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Lead-acid Battery,Operational,"Metlakatla Power and Light (MP&amp;amp;L) has a BESS installation consisting of Exide (GNB Industrial Power) VRLA cells, providing rapid spinning reserve, frequency control, and better power quality. Beginning operation in 1997, the MP&amp;amp;L BESS has a 1 MW peak power output, and 1.4 MWh energy capacity. It is capable of supporting continuous loads of 800 kilovolt amperes (kVA), pulse loads up to 1200 kVA, and consists of 378 Absolyte VRLA 100A75 modules. Nearly 5 MW of hydroelectric generation capacity provides almost all of MP&amp;amp;L’s power, with a 3.3 MW diesel generation system relegated to reserve duty. MP&amp;amp;L’s two hydroelectric plants, Purple Lake and Chester Lake, have reservoir storage capacity, though the hydro generators were too slow to respond to sudden load fluctuations. At the time of the BESS’s initial operations, the MP&amp;amp;L peak load was approximately 4 MW. A lumber mill in Metlakatla (since closed down) caused large, sudden power spikes on the community’s islanded power system, and the BESS was installed to provide fast response for the mill’s rapid load changes.  The MP&amp;amp;L BESS is housed in a purpose-built 40-foot by 70-foot steel butler building that sits on a cement pad. Installation cost of the 1 MW / 1.4 MWh Exide Metlakatla BESS was $1.6 million in 1996 dollars (estimated cost in 2009 dollars: $2.2 million). The battery system became operational in February 1997. It operated continuously for 11.5 years until September 2008, when the battery was replaced with a new VRLA product. The VRLA battery exceeded its 8-year design life by over 3 years. The BESS is estimated to have saved MP&amp;amp;L over $6.5 million over its life in reduced fuel consumption and maintenance, in addition to reduced greenhouse emissions. A new battery was installed with the support of the Alaska Commerce, Community, and Economic Development Agency, so the BESS will continue to provide benefits to the community for many years to come.

Tehachapi Wind Energy Storage Project - Southern California Edison,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"&lt;p&gt;The Tehachapi Wind Energy Storage Project, funded by Southern California Edison (SCE) and federal stimulus funding awarded by the Department of Energy as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, is positioned to demonstrate the effectiveness of lithium-ion battery and smart inverter technologies to improve grid performance and assist in the integration of variable energy resources. The project is based at SCE’s Monolith Substation in Tehachapi, California and includes a 32 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) and the associated power conversion system. The project will evaluate the performance of the BESS to improve grid performance and assist in the integration of large-scale variable energy resourced generation. Project performance will be measured with 13 specific operational uses: 1. Provide voltage support and grid stabilization 2. Decrease transmission losses 3. Diminish congestion 4. Increase system reliability 5. Defer transmission investment 6. Optimize size of new renewable-related transmission 7. Provide system capacity and resource adequacy 8. Integrate renewable energy (smoothing) 9. Shift wind generation output 10. Frequency regulation 11. Spin / non-spin replacement reserves 12. Ramp management 13. Energy price arbitrage. Most of the operations either shift other generation resources to meet peak load and other electricity system needs with stored electricity, or resolve grid stability and capacity concerns that result from the interconnection of variable energy resources. SCE will also demonstrate the ability of lithium-ion battery storage to provide nearly instantaneous maximum capacity for supply-side ramp rate control to minimize the need for fossil fuel-powered back-up generation.&lt;/p&gt;",8000,35.036143,-118.28,,"Electric Supply Capacity, Renewables Capacity Firming, Transmission Congestion Relief, Transportable Transmission/Distribution Upgrade Deferral, Voltage Support, ",Tehachapi,California,United States,,01.07.2014,01.10.2013,,CAISO,Southern California Edison,Investor Owned,Transmission,Wind,Southern California Edison,0,,49956528,0,National Energy Technology Laboratory,,DD.45.YYYY 22:45:40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
